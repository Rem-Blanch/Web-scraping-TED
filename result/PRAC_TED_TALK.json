    " Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED Connects. This is a new series of live conversations, trying to make sense of this weird moment that we're in: coronavirus. Everyone's suddenly changing how they live their lives, it's so jolting, it's so startling. We're all trying to make sense of it, and it ain't easy. That much we know. We're trying to make sense of this together in the only way that we know how, which is by having wise humans coming on, talking to each other, listening to each other trying to learn from each other. We are apart, but we can use this moment to build community together, and that's what we're trying to do. ",
    " So this is being produced by a virtual TED team scattered around New York, currently one of the epicenters of this pandemic. So it's definitely a scary time for people here. I'd like to welcome to join me my cohost here, Whitney Pennington Rodgers. She's our current affairs curator. ",
    " Whitney Pennington Rodgers: We're going to be looking a little bit at China's response today. When news surfaced about a strange viral outbreak in Wuhan, China at the very last days of 2019, I think a lot of people were confused about what was going on there, and in the months that followed, we learned more about the disease that's now known as COVID-19, we watched the situation in China quickly worsen and in the most recent weeks dramatically improve. And I think as all of us around the world grapple with how we can contain and control the spread of COVID-19, there are a lot of lessons we can learn from what China experienced and how they responded. So we're really thrilled to be joined today by the CEO of the \"South China Morning Post,\" Gary Liu, who's here to share his perspective and insights. So, welcome Gary. ",
    " Gary Liu: Thanks for having me. ",
    " WPR: Hey there, Gary, thanks for being with us. And I think before we dive into things, I'd love to hear about just how things have been for you personally, your loved ones, those close to you, how have you been experiencing this? ",
    " GL: It's complicated. So we're here in Hong Kong, I'm working from home, like much of Hong Kong. I'm actually self-quarantined in our apartment here in Hong Kong, because there was a confirmed case in our workplace. So over the course of the last week plus, and likely for at least another week plus, the entire organization has been distributed and working from home. ",
    " You know, when Hong Kong got its first confirmed case, I was actually back in the United States with my wife, we were taking a small break in the Rockies, and we came back to Hong Kong pretty soon after that to make sure we got back into Hong Kong before the airports shut. And at that point, it was all of our family in the United States and friends texting us and worrying about how things were in Hong Kong as the situation in China started escalating, and people were sending us, or trying to send us, supplies. Masks and sanitizer and stuff like that. And now it's the opposite. New York City is our home, so we certainly empathize with what you guys are dealing with right now and going through in the city. And we are seeing our friends and our family back home in New York and in California and checking in on them, trying to send equipment and materials back to them, so the script has flipped actually pretty fast over just the last couple of weeks. ",
    " WPR: And you know, I think that's actually a really interesting place to start and probably a question that a lot of people who aren't in China have, you know, I think from the outside looking in, it seems as if what's happened in China is kind of miraculous. That to go from, you know, you have a country with more than a billion people there, to go from as many as 80,000 cases to nearly zero new cases now, you know, what can you tell us about how this happened, to help us understand the current situation and just really how China ended up there? ",
    " GL: Yeah, a lot has happened. China has been dealing with this for several months now. Several-month head start, that's not a good thing, but they have gone through several different phases. I think, Whitney, before I jump into it, there are a couple of caveats that are really important to make. The first one is that we're still parsing what happened in China. The information system, as everyone knows, is still relatively closed. And so a lot of the information that we're using to piece together what happened in China is still not fully complete. And so with every passing day, every passing week, there's more information that allows us to retroactively make sure that we get the picture of what happened early on in those early days at the end of 2019, get that picture right. And there's still a lot that's happening today, even though I think the information sharing is much more open than it was early on, there's still a lot of stuff that we need to parse. ",
    " And the second important caveat here is that I think learning sometimes suggests that everything China did was right and good, and hopefully, other countries can take it and apply it, but that's not 100 percent the case. China, of course, did a lot that was right, and if we walked through the time line, I think it would be pretty apparent the decisions that they made kept the coronavirus from really exploding across the entire country and really limited it to one province and mostly one city. But there were also many, many missteps, and those are things that I think the world can also learn from, most importantly, China should learn from, because most of these \u2014 I think those of us who are professional observers would call missteps, are because they are systemic issues with the country, because of governance, lack of free information flow, stuff like that. Those are the initial caveats, but I think the timing of how China progressed from first case to now has been fascinating. ",
    " WPR: Yeah, and I mean, so we know now that in Hubei province they've officially lifted the two-month lockdown. And are you getting the sense, do you feel like this is the right decision to make at this moment? ",
    " GL: I don't think I'm the right person to say whether or not it's the right decision. But certainly, this has been a progression of decisions, and I think they've been sitting on this decision for quite some time. Wuhan itself, which was where the pandemic started, it was the first epicenter and the major epicenter. Wuhan is opening up on April 8, that's right now the schedule. And this is really, what we're in now is the third of three phases from the first discovery of the virus in Wuhan. Now, April 8 will be about 11 weeks after Wuhan the city got completely shut down, and the Hubei province got shut down. And so for those who are in a shelter, at home kind of situations right now in the United States and wondering how long this is going to take, in Wuhan, they've been locked down for 11 weeks and only now has the Chinese government decided they're ready to start letting people move freely around. ",
    " WPR: And to your point earlier about some of the possible missteps in terms of reporting, I mean, there are still reports now that we might not be getting an accurate number of cases that we're seeing in Wuhan or beyond, we're hearing some people say there are no new cases, other people saying that there actually are cases. So do you feel like there is accurate spread of information about the current state of the virus in China right now? ",
    " GL: Generally, yes, with the caveat that it is based on the Chinese government's definition. And this is one of the problems right now that even the World Health Organization is struggling with, is that the definition of what is a confirmed case, what is an infection, is different from country to country. As an example, in China, the folks that have tested positive but are asymptomatic, we understand now that they are not included, since February 7, they have not been included in the official numbers. Or at the very least, on February 7, they changed that definition, and they're not included in those official numbers. And that could be another 50 percent on top of the numbers that we're seeing today. So what we've found, our reporters have gotten their hands on some classified government documents and government data that suggests that a third of total actual positive tests are asymptomatic, and therefore not included in official numbers. Now, I don't think that this is an example of the Chinese government trying to hide information. This is a definitions issue, which countries have been debating and people are doing it in different ways. But like I said, there really have been three very distinct phases. We are in the third phase that I would call recovery and rehabilitation, rehabilitation being the rehabilitation of China's image. But the first part was discovery and a lot of denial. And then there was this two-and-a-half-month period of response and containment. And that I think, the response and containment part is the most interesting to the rest of the world. ",
    " WPR: And so maybe we can break some of that down, you know, thinking about China's response. What were some of the specific things that you think China did right, both as a nation, individuals in the country, what were some of the things that you saw that worked really well? ",
    " GL: OK, so let me walk through the time line, I want to try and get these dates right, because the dates do matter, I think again, for context, how many weeks it took from one step to another. Let me actually back up into that initial first phase, that discovery and denial phase. ",
    " The first time we heard about the coronavirus, this mysterious respiratory disease that looks somewhat like SARS, was on December 30. That was the day that there was a doctor, whose name is known all over the world for the unfortunate reason he ended up eventually dying, named Li Wenliang. And Li Wenliang, Dr. Li, posted to a private WeChat group on December 30. These were some of his old classmates from med school. And he said, \"Hey, I'm in Wuhan, I'm at the hospital, there is a SARS-like illness,\" SARS being the epidemic from 2002 to 2003, \"There's a SARS-like illness that is spreading through these hospitals in Wuhan.\" A private message. Somebody forwarded it, and it went viral across the Chinese internet. The very next \u2014 so that was the first time we actually heard about something that was going on in Wuhan. The very next day, December 31, was the first time that any Chinese officials \u2014 and on that day, it happened to be the actual provincial and the city officials \u2014 acknowledged that there were 27 people, at that moment in time, who had been diagnosed with this mysterious pneumonia, and they reported the cases to the World Health Organization. That was also the day that Dr. Li was reprimanded, officially reprimanded. ",
    " So that was really the discovery, the end of the discovery and denial phase, because what we know now is that back to mid-December, several weeks before Dr. Li wrote his blog post, the authorities had already been notified that a SARS-like pneumonia was showing up in Wuhan hospitals. And action had already started down the chain of authority. They have now backdated, at least publicly backdated, the first case to December 1. But actually, in their confidential and classified government documents that again, our journalists have seen, and we've published a story \u2014 Officially, in classified documents, they've backdated the first COVID-19 case all the way back to November 17, as the earliest example that they can find based on symptoms and based on retroactive diagnosis for a COVID-19 case. So in effect, there were several weeks before the acknowledgment to the World Health Organization that that was going on, and the first case with symptoms was actually identified about a month and a half before that notice to the World Health Organization. ",
    " Then the second phase, which really started, let's say, December 31, when the acknowledgment happened, was response and then massive containment. Now this phase, to be clear, still had some denial and a good amount of censorship happening within the country. So on January 1, the World Health Organization started working with China on trying to identify the virus and trying to figure out course of action. It wasn't until several weeks later that Beijing, the central government, for the first time broke its silence, and that was on January 18. And actually, they broke the silence to deny that this was SARS, and in fact to \"defy rumors\" that were spreading around the Chinese internet. ",
    " But there was a major date that happened two days afterwards, which was January 20. Because for the first time, a member of the party, a senior government official who is now one of the central gentlemen that is actually leading the task force against COVID-19, his name is Zhong Nanshan, he's an epidemiologist, he was one of the central figures during SARS 17 years ago. On January 20, he visited Wuhan. And he admitted, for the first time, that human-to-human transmission was possible. Now this was important, because prior to that, officials who had spoken up had said that human-to-human transmission was not likely, was not possible. And previous to that, all of the cases, the majority of the cases were tied to this seafood and wildlife marketplace that was in the city of Wuhan. But now, on January 20, human-to-human transmission, it's possible, it's happening, and so of course, the course of action, not only in China, but the course of action all over the world, started to change. And three days after that, Wuhan was locked down. It was completely, I mean, it shocked the world that they could lock down that many people so quickly. Of course, now India yesterday announced that 1.3 billion people are being locked down. So we have another frame of reference now. ",
    " And then the end of this middle second phase I think really came in March, around March 10. Actually, on March 10 I should say, because Chinese president, Xi Jinping, visited Wuhan. And these things, in Chinese politics, because everything is so well-choreographed, matters a whole lot. The fact that Xi Jinping visited Wuhan signaled that the Chinese government believed the worst was over. The reality was that probably about 20 days before that, the curve had already been flattened. So 20 days before that, probably around February 20, the infection rate was around 75,000, 76,000, and it's effectively stayed within a couple of thousand since then. So on March 10, Xi Jinping's visit to Wuhan kind of signaled the worst is over, and then they moved into the recovery and rehabilitation phase. ",
    " WPR: OK. I mean, if I'm hearing correctly \u2014 thank you for sharing all of that, it sounds like, although there was a slow period of getting the information out initially, eventually there was quick reaction from the Chinese government to respond to this, lock folks down. And it seems like that had a real impact on flattening the curve in China, in Wuhan. ",
    " GL: A real impact. ",
    " WPR: Yeah and I \u2014 ",
    " GL: Absolutely. ",
    " WPR: Yes, please go ahead, Gary. ",
    " GL: The date of January 23 was not by coincidence. Because the Chinese New Year holiday started on January 24, the very next day. And the thing is, with the Chinese New Year holiday, is that it is, every single year, it's the largest human migration that happens on Earth. About 400 million people travel during about a forty-day period that would have started on January 24. And that's three billion trips, it's just people traveling all over the country, 400 million people traveling. Now, Wuhan is one of the most important cities in China, although before this, I don't think a lot of people around the world knew the city of Wuhan, but it's extremely important. It is considered the most important city in the center of China for many different reasons, but one of the key reasons is that it is one of the key transportation hubs of the country. So all of the major train lines, the high-speed train lines, the normal train lines, the trade lines, they all kind of converge on Wuhan. So you can imagine if 400 million people start moving around for Chinese New Year on January 24, a huge number of them were going to go through Wuhan. And of course, Wuhan itself is an 11-million-person city. The surrounding cities all added together, Hubei province has about 60 million people, and they were also largely going to travel. And so if January 23 they had not shut it down, and people had started traveling, the likelihood would have been that this would have been really, really hard, possibly, likely impossible to contain. And even though they shut down before the Chinese New Year holiday started, we now also know that at least five million people actually left the surrounding areas and traveled. Which is one of the reasons why it did spread a little bit across the country, and then eventually spread to other parts of the world. ",
    " WPR: And I'd like to come back to that as well, just thinking about the five million people who left and sort of where they landed today and how that affected things, but before we do that, I'm interested to talk with you a little bit more about \u2014 you mentioned this November date as one of the earliest cases you discovered that was reported was in November, and that's something actually that I hadn't heard before, and I imagine that might be news to a lot of people hearing this, and so I'm curious, when you think about the missteps from China's perspective, in terms of what China did, you know, there is, as you mentioned, suppression of information is one thing, one major criticism of how China handled this. And hearing that maybe there was knowledge of something as early as November, if that might have played a role in how we were able to control and contain this a lot sooner. ",
    " GL: I do want to clarify, from what we understand, officials were not notified about this until mid-December. It wasn't \u2014 So it was really a couple of weeks between officials realizing that there was a SARS-like pneumonia going around to when the first case was reported to the World Health Organization. It wasn't all the way back to November 17. That was retroactively backdated, but that has not been made public by the government. We published it because we've seen the data that actually backdates the first case. From a misstep point of view, again, it's a couple of weeks compared to what happened in SARS, which was a long time of locking down on information. This was much shorter, the period of time that the government wasn't in complete shutdown mode. But then, after that, of course, there was still continued censorship on the internet, especially within the Great Firewall of China, for communications between Chinese citizens. And you know, surprisingly to some, I think for a lot of China watchers not so surprisingly, is that the government has \u2014 the central government \u2014 over the course of the last several weeks, actually, I should say probably the last two months, has started to change their tone and to some degree admit that there needed to be better free flow of information. They've changed the official narrative of a couple of different things, including this initial whistleblower, Dr. Li, who unfortunately ended up passing away from the virus, they actually now refer to him as a national hero, they have officially removed the reprimand, the Wuhan police have apologized to Dr. Li's family, and they have actually been \u2014 a couple of policemen \u2014 have been punished in Wuhan for the way that they handled the situation. So there has definitely been an internal shift and there is a lot more sharing of data and information. I can tell you, from Hong Kong's point of view, without the open sharing of information between the authorities, between Hong Kong and mainland China, I think Hong Kong's response would have been much more different and I think Hong Kong would have suffered because of that. So that much more open sharing of information has benefited this city for sure. ",
    " WPR: And we have Chris here who has a question, I think, from the audience. ",
    " CA: Hey, Gary. The online audience, loving what you're saying. It's so interesting, you're giving us amazing new insights here. Just in the current situation where much of \u2014 you know, there have been these very few reports of new cases. How much does it feel like life is getting back to normal? Do people really believe that this problem has been successfully tackled elsewhere? ",
    " GL: I think the sentiment in mainland China is that yes, in China, the problem has been tackled. And people are looking forward to going back to normal life. A lot of the other major cities, Shanghai, Beijing, are starting to get back to work. Many of the factories have now been reopened. The last stat that I saw was that 90 percent of the businesses that had been shut down are now reopened in China. So generally speaking, life is getting back to normal. Wuhan and Hubei are really the last places that are still shut down, with Wuhan being the city that is shut down until April 8. Hong Kong is a little bit different. Hong Kong has actually gone back into a second wave of social isolation and distancing. A bunch of different companies, us included, as well as the Hong Kong government and the civil service has now gone back to work from home. And it's because we are starting to see a second wave, but for us, honestly, is the first time that we've had a spike of infections, and it's because of imported cases. It's because a lot of Hong Kong residents who left Hong Kong prior to, well, actually when the virus first came into the city, are now returning, because oddly enough, the places they escaped to are now more dangerous than Hong Kong. And as they're coming back, a lot of them are actually bringing the virus back with them. And so we're starting to see a spike. Before this week, the highest infection day that Hong Kong had during the first two months of this was 10 infections in one day. Now the highest that we've seen in the last week was 48. So this is really the first spike that we're seeing, and so Hong Kong is returning back to a state of alertness, to a state of caution, and more and more people are holed up at home. ",
    " CA: Is it possible, in mainland China, that because of this redefinition that you spoke about, where if someone tests positive, but they're not showing symptoms, that is not reported as a case. That seems significant to me. Is that part of the explanation for why new reports have gone nearly to zero? ",
    " GL: I don't know if that's the answer to it, but I do actually think that even with \u2014 and remember, these are folks that are tested, so the data that we have is that these folks have been tested, the tests have come back positive, but have not been added to the official number of infections, because they're asymptomatic. But they have still gone through the process that is part of China's containment strategy, which has worked extraordinarily well. Which is, first of all, lots and lots of people have been tested. And then once \u2014 if there is a positive test return, regardless of whether or not they're symptomatic or asymptomatic, regardless of whether or not they're added to official numbers, what happens next is that they are quarantined, they're isolated, and contact tracing happens. Contact tracing is a key, key, key action. And so they go and figure out where this person has been moving, where they've been, who they've been in contact with, and all those folks that they've been in close contact with, they get tested. And if they come back with a positive test, then they're also isolated and they go through the process again. So China has not been testing people, finding that they're asymptomatic and then just releasing them and letting them go home. That's not the case. ",
    " WPR: I think to that point too, Gary, what you mentioned about this trace-testing and being able to figure out who people have been in contact with to figure out who may also have been infected, you know, when you look at what's happening in other parts of the world, you hear in the United States, where Chris and I are based right now, you're hearing that people who are experiencing symptoms, have symptoms cannot get tested. You know, how does China's ability to test so many people affect the way that they can respond to this and control this virus? ",
    " GL: It really matters. Without the significant testing and without the contact tracing that comes afterwards, I don't think there's a way that China could have contained it the way that they did. The same thing here in Hong Kong. If we didn't have both of those, as minimum requirements in a health system, Hong Kong could not have contained it. And this is actually the reason why South Korea is the only other country besides China that has managed to flatten the curve, is because they aggressively tested. I think by far the highest per capita testing anywhere in the world, as far as we know right now. And they aggressively did contact tracing. And because of that, even though South Korea had this huge spike, and we thought that it was going to get out of hand, they were able to suppress it, control it, and now they're in a much, much better place. ",
    " WPR: One thing you mentioned earlier that I'd love to talk about, too, is SARS and the impact of going through that in 2002 and 2003 for China, other countries in Asia, Hong Kong. You know, what effect did that have on everyone's preparedness in that part of the world for the COVID-19 outbreak? ",
    " GL: It was significant. I think the institutional and social memory of SARS matters a heck of a lot, when you look at China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, a lot of these countries in Asia have dealt with COVID-19. Let me use Hong Kong as an example, because it's the one that I know the most intimately. But a lot of what I'm about to say actually does apply to those other areas of Asia. ",
    " So for context, SARS, November 2002 to July 2003, very, very similar coronavirus to COVID-19, I think there's about an 80 percent similarity to those two viruses. The global infected number was a little over 8,000, 774 deaths. So by percentage, deadlier than COVID-19 is but far less infectious than COVID-19 is. Now here's why it impacted Hong Kong so much, and why the memory is so deep, and actually it tells you a lot about Hong Kong's reaction to COVID-19. Of the 8,000 infected, 22 percent were here in the city of 7.5 million, and 40 percent, actually 39 percent of the deaths, 299 people died in Hong Kong. Thirty-nine percent of the global deaths happened in Hong Kong. And SARS did not start in Hong Kong, it was imported into Hong Kong from southern China. And so SARS, again, deep, deep memory, but it was a massive turning point in the Hong Kong health care system and also the social practices of the city. And let me walk through some of that impact, because you can actually still see it, even before COVID-19, you see it every day. The health care system was able to really, very quickly, ramp up in capacity, because of preparation post-SARS. ",
    " So after SARS, the Hong Kong health care authorities started preparing for greater capacity, especially for infectious diseases. There were new health alert systems, warnings and treatment protocols put in place. I can tell you that a lot of folks that were here before SARS will tell you that in Hong Kong hospitals, before SARS, it was actually rare to see even medical professionals wear face masks. And now surgical masks are ubiquitous, not only in hospitals, but across the entire city. Anytime, anywhere, it seems, especially right now. New channels of communication and data and information exchange were opened up with mainland Chinese authorities, and technology was implemented, including now a supercomputer that actually does contact tracing in Hong Kong. You could trace the existence of the supercomputer and this contact-tracing ability back to changes that happened post-SARS. ",
    " On the social side, there was also a huge change. The first thing I have to talk about is, of course, masks. Now, I know that there is still not consensus everywhere in the world about whether or not masks actually help in this situation. I know that the World Health Organization as well as governments like the US, as well as Singapore, say that only medical personnel as well as people who are actually sick and showing symptoms need to be wearing masks. In Hong Kong, everyone wears masks. And the government, even though they flip-flopped a little bit during this epidemic, the general, the guidance is that everyone should be wearing masks. That started in SARS. Ninety percent of Hong Kongers during SARS wore masks, and that habit actually stayed with Hong Kongers, and so generally speaking, even outside of the pandemic, when people are sick and coughing, you'll see them wear masks out in public. On top of that, there was \u2014 it became systemic, or I should say systematic controls for hygiene in social and public spaces. So if you visit Hong Kong, again, before all of this happened, you would have noticed that public spaces are constantly being disinfected. One good example that everyone notices is that when you go into an elevator in public spaces, in buildings, they will either have one of two things, potentially both. They'll either have a sign that tells you how often the elevator buttons are disinfected, or there will be a plastic, piece of sticky plastic, like a plastic sheet over the buttons so it effectively becomes a flat surface. ",
    " When you eat out, Hong Kong is obviously famous for its dim sum, and one of the most famous things about Hong Kong dim sum are the dim sum carts, which are also very popular in New York's Chinatown, as an example. Those dim sum carts, they pretty much went away after SARS. And so most dim sum restaurants that you'll go to in Hong Kong now, the vast majority of them, you have to order off of a menu, you don't have public carts going around because of hygiene issues. In most nice Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong now you will get, when you sit down, two pairs of chopsticks per person. And those two pairs of chopsticks are different colored, because one is used to grab food from the center of the table to your plate, and the other one is for you to take the food and put it in your mouth. And honestly, there are hand sanitizers and hand-washing notices literally everywhere, and this is just part of the social behavior after SARS. Safety protocols in offices, everyone knows how to shut down an office and control traffic really well. Most major offices have temperature-check machines at the very least available, and then, of course, social distancing. ",
    " People understand social distancing is important, and so the moment there was fear of what was happening across the border, naturally, people started social-distancing activities and self-quarantine became pretty normal. So those are all the social things as well as the health system things that kind of changed, and because of that, Hong Kong was able to react really, really fast, not just the government, not just the health authorities but the people of Hong Kong, and I think that's the most important part, is that the entire city, that the community reacted and went into this mode where you wore masks, you washed your hands, you carried hand sanitizer, you stopped going to public places. ",
    " WPR: I'm curious then, I think a lot of people who are listening at home and figuring out how can we apply some of those things here, and from where you sit, and when you see what's going on in other parts of the world, where maybe people are struggling to make some of these changes. You know, what are some of the specific things you think folks can adapt in their own cultures, in their own countries? ",
    " GL: I think communication is a huge deal. If you talk to local Hong Kongers, they will likely opine that the communication from the Hong Kong government has not been top notch. But thankfully, there have been other authorities and certainly even just person-to-person communication has been pretty strong. A lot of corporates have done an incredible job in Hong Kong in communicating very transparently with their employees and insurance companies have also been making available all sorts of webinars and materials and made it actually quite easy for people to understand how to get tested, where to get tested, who to get tested. And so that communication, I think, has centralized, to some degree, the messaging. In a city like Hong Kong, everyone generally believes the same thing, and what they believe is generally true. Of course, there's still misinformation issues, as there are everywhere. But I think, possibly also because of SARS, because over the course of the 17 years, a lot of the misinformation has now been vetted, everyone knows what is true, so there is already, sort of, an internal radar or at least alarm bell for things that seem to be wrong. So I think communication is really important, from government, from corporates anywhere in the world. And I think if there is a recommendation for health systems, I know getting tests is really difficult. One of the things that has made testing in China and Hong Kong certainly so effective, is that there is point-of-care testing, that still really doesn't exist, or at least doesn't exist in volume in the US. And so they have to save these tests and only a certain number of people can get tested, the triage system then becomes overflowing. Whereas here, generally speaking, everyone can get tested, and then of course, the contact tracing. Everyone knows that if somebody that you've been in contact with tests positive, you're going to be called in by the hospital authorities and you're going to be tested, and then if you're positive, everyone you've been in contact with for the last two weeks will also be called in. And people don't really see it as an annoyance, it's just what needs to be done. And I think because of that, again, the containment has been effective. ",
    " WPR: Great. And we have a question from Chris here. ",
    " CA: Gary, it actually builds on the point you just made, people are puzzled online, how is it that China avoided the explosion of cases in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, where people were coming there from Wuhan. How on earth did some of those cases not explode? Was it just down to really diligent contact tracing? ",
    " GL: I think it was a combination of things. First of all, the shutdown of Hubei province certainly helped. And then, the major cities actually went into isolation and quarantine as well. Remember, it was Chinese New Year, so there was no one working that week. And so everyone just went home. And generally speaking, in most major cities, they locked their doors and they didn't leave. Now, China is very prepared for this, because the technology stack in China, including consumer site services, make it really easy to lock your doors and get everything delivered to you. This is infrastructure and this is consumer behavior that is already ingrained, especially in major cities across China. So people just went home. There was also a stigma issue, which is unfortunate for people from Hubei, and especially from Wuhan. But there are plenty of stories in the other major Chinese cities where anyone coming from Hubei or with any connection to Wuhan were ostracized during those early days, especially after the Wuhan lockdown. And so folks that might have been, in fact, carrying the virus, because they were from the epicenter, they were either self-quarantined, or they were forcibly quarantined, because no one was going to spend time with them anyway. So I think for a lot of those reasons, some of them social, some of them systemic, they made it so that there was much less person-to-person contact, especially after the authorities admitted that human-to-human transmission was possible. ",
    " CA: Hospitals here in New York, there are warnings that they're about to get overwhelmed. What can we learn from what happened in Wuhan, some of the scenes from there were horrifying, but there were amazing stories as well. What should we learn from what happened there? ",
    " GL: Well, it started off horrifying. So in the early days, post-lockdown, all the stories coming out of Wuhan, we had journalists that were there right before the lockdown, they got out about three hours before the lockdown happened, and we had people what ended up having to be quarantined, because they were stuck in Hubei. As well as a lot of citizen journalists that were documenting what was going on, and those images, like you said, Chris, were horrifying. There were videos showing people literally laying on the ground. Some were just so sick they couldn't move, others had already died and they were just covered with plastic sheets. There were nurses and doctors that were just crying in front of the camera, begging for help. And so, I think it's important to understand that China's health care system did not just immediately become effective. And certainly not in Wuhan. There was not that much information, people didn't know what they were dealing with. Certainly, the authorities were trying to help, I think at that moment, but again, the information flow was not that free. And during lockdown, people were screaming off of their balconies, because they couldn't get food, they couldn't even go to the hospital, because the public transportation systems got locked down. Remember, this is not, Wuhan is not a city like New York where most of New York is walkable. For people who don't have cars, and many, many of the Wuhan residents don't have cars, if the buses are locked down, then they might have to walk three, four hours, to get to a hospital. Maybe not that long, but they have to walk a long way to get to a hospital. And so a lot of people were just stuck at home, and they were unable to initially get any diagnosis or any health care. And so it was a disaster. But then the capacity actually ramped up. The triage system became extremely effective. ",
    " I think most people have heard now that there were two massive hospitals with thousands of beds of capacity that were built within 10 days. And this is true, they came out of nowhere, they were literally just parking lots or flat ground, and two major hospital units were built up. To be clear, also, those were the triage units for those who have very mild symptoms. But that's really important. Being able to get people with mild symptoms out of the major hospital systems, so that they're not taking up the resources of nurses and doctors, they are not taking up the diagnostic equipment for the second confirmation tests, and also, especially, they are not taking up isolation wards and ventilators. And so the moment people started being moved out, the mild symptoms, the ones that were going to survive and they just really needed to be separate from family and have some antiviral medication, once they were moved out into these new hospitals, the main hospitals in Wuhan and across Hubei could deal with the primary patients, especially those that are critical, of the overall tested population and do their best and try and save them and make sure that they're not highly infectious. At the same time, I think that the health authorities in China, especially the nurses and the doctors, did a very good job of also protecting themselves. So there have been far fewer, by percentage, infections and deaths, of medical staff than there were during SARS. ",
    " CA: I mean, to respond that effectively took a kind of top-down drive. Plus a willingness of a lot of people to risk their own well-being in a way for their perception of what they had to do for the public good. You are well aware of the cultural differences between China, Hong Kong and the West. Do you \u2014 how do you rate the chances of, say, the US responding effectively should things really explode here, as they seem like they may be about to? ",
    " GL: In the health care system side, I have every confidence that the US health care system is going to be able to respond well. I have many, many friends who are medical professionals in the United States, and they are raising their hands and volunteering and going to hospitals to see where they can help. So I have full trust in the system, and the people that man those systems. Our health care capacity in the United States is also significantly greater, doctors per capita, than in China. And because of the fact that also, our health care system is not just relying on hospitals, but there are primary care physicians scattered all over the country, as long as the testing capacity and testing kits are available across the country, general practitioners can actually administer those. And it certainly sounds like more and more med tech start-ups in the US are now trying to create these home kits, so that people can start testing at home. That will help a lot. My hope is certainly that the citizens of the US, that people are going to take this very, very seriously and realize that it doesn't matter that you may not feel sick, it doesn't matter if you think you are young and that you are not prone to catching this virus, or that you're not in \u2014 you may not be fearful of dire consequences and death. Take it seriously and stay home. And don't go to public spaces, and don't be a carrier, because we now know that asymptomatic folks can be carriers and there is a possibility that you can be infectious as an asymptomatic carrier. So yeah, on the cultural side \u2014 I don't think it's really cultural. I would say that it's because of the impact of SARS, it's because of the social memory of SARS that has meant people are a little bit more selfless, and have just said, \"OK, I will stay home, because I might have come in contact.\" ",
    " CA: Yeah, weirdly, SARS seems to have acted as its own kind of vaccine, sort of just prepped the system enough for people to be ready. Yeah, social vaccine, amazing. Back to you, Whitney. ",
    " WPR: OK, great, thanks so much, Chris. And so I think it's interesting, Gary, to hear you talk about some of the reactions in Wuhan and some of the stories that you've heard, especially running the \"South China Morning Post\" and running a news organization during this outbreak. You know, what are some of the \u2014 First, what is that like, to run a news organization, to report during this outbreak? ",
    " GL: Well, running a news organization in a moment like this, so close to the initial epicenter where the outbreak started, is complicated. We were lucky, very, very lucky that most of our senior editors, and certainly the most senior editors, our editor in chief, our masthead leadership, they were all journalists and they were reporters during SARS. So there's a lot of pattern recognition in our newsroom. Which meant the moment that we got the first, sort of, the first stories coming out of China, starting on December 30, people already raising their hands in the newsroom saying, \"Hey, we've got to report about this like it's going to be the next SARS. There's a high likelihood that this is it.\" And we did send people to Wuhan early on in January. Like I said, we also had reporters there right before the lockdown. After the lockdown, we were lucky enough to pull all of them out of Wuhan. But we actually did change very quickly the way that we report. Partially to make sure we got the story right, to dig deeper in the places that we knew we had to dig deeper, but also to protect our journalists and employees. So one of the things that we did do, and maybe other news organizations would disagree with our decision, was I think in late January or early February, even in Hong Kong, we said to our journalists, \"You are not to go into hospitals.\" So no more in-hospital reporting. Because they were \u2014 we knew that it was highly infectious, we were worried that they were going to become you know, points of spread, and we just wanted to protect our employees and our company, so we did that. We also had a business continuity plan. Which meant that at the drop of a dime we could shut down the entire office and still operate this global news business. Some of the most interesting stories we've covered is actually how technology has played a huge role in China during this epidemic. Because it frankly has changed the way that diagnostics work, it changed the way that containment works, it certainly has changed the way that consumer life works. And of course, there's been a lot of instances of really interesting censorship, but also, more interestingly, how the Chinese netizens have fought that censorship and reacted to that censorship. And I do think that there's quite a lot of lasting impacts that are likely to happen because of technology deployment during this time. ",
    " WPR: And so I think in talking about some of those lasting impacts, now that you as a country are sort of emerging from this and coming on into a different stage with this outbreak, what are some of the changes you're seeing to daily life, both as society, and maybe things that you're hearing that individuals are experiencing as a result of this? ",
    " GL: Yeah, I think probably the two most interesting changes, actually, I should say three \u2014 The first one is on education. Now schools have been shut down across China for quite some time now and again, this might feel a little bit stereotypical, or a caricature of China, but education is extremely important to the country and extremely important to the citizens. And we were actually just about to come up to the national exams, which these students work 18 years for. And so online education \u2014 very, very quickly moved online. And part of that move online was that courses had to be, and classes had to be recorded. Which means that now, there's this huge repository of recorded classes. That means potential democratization of education material, and significantly lowered costs to get this type of coursework from the top tiered schools, whether it's high schools, universities or primary schools, to the entire country. Now whether or not China activates on that, we're still not sure, but the potential is there. ",
    " The second major shift is really on distributed workforce. The idea of working remotely, office work remotely, is not much of a concept in China and across most of Asia. Certainly far less than in the United States. And I'm from the US tech industry, so it was pretty normal, it's pretty normal in the US tech industry even before this, in China much less so. But because of the lockdowns, not only in Hubei but across China, this has become much more normal. And people are kind of falling into a different rhythm of work. And most importantly, this has given rise to a whole new set of teleconferencing companies in China. Because most of the teleconferencing companies that we know of in the West, whether it's the Cisco systems, Google Hangouts, Zoom, that everyone uses, BlueJeans, Slack video, they're not available in China. They don't work in China. There is this mirror internet in China, behind the Great Firewall, and so there's a whole new set of teleconferencing systems that were used, but were not really commonplace, certainly not for distributed workforce, and now suddenly, over the last few months, they are. So it will be interesting to see how those companies and those services develop, and whether or not the workplace changes in China. ",
    " And then finally, the third thing that is really interesting is that there was a huge internet response to this censorship issue in China over the course of the last two months. It especially exploded after this whistle blower, Dr. Li, died on February 7. All over the Chinese internet hashtags like \"we want freedom of speech,\" \"national hero Dr. Li,\" things like that just exploded everywhere. And there have been \u2014 And actually the Chinese government has had to respond, I think for observers, a lot of observers believe that Chinese government's change of narrative about Dr. Li was largely driven by this reaction from its citizens across the internet. There have been extremely creative examples of people getting around censorship. I think China is quite famous for using emojis to get around tech censorship. I think most people also know that the primary messaging app that the Chinese internet users use, called WeChat, it is heavily censored, it's not just text that's censored, images are censored really effectively, individual conversations are censored. And so when there are specific articles or specific posts that are about what's happening with the virus that people want to share, and the government thinks that it is detrimental to whatever, they will censor and it will be completely and very effectively removed. But this time around, Chinese citizens used emojis again. They translated these posts into ancient Chinese texts that the censoring machines couldn't pick up yet, they actually translated one version of this post into Tolkien's Elvish language, I don't even know the name of that language, they translated into that and the AI couldn't pick it up. And then finally, I think one of my favorite versions of this was they used the \"Star Wars\" intro, the angled text scrolling, it became a video, and they had the entire post about what was going on in Wuhan in that format, and that went all over the internet. So I do think that there is going to be an increased call. Academics now are speaking up about freedom of speech. So there's going to be this increased volume of netizens calling for freedom of speech. It will be very, very interesting to watch how the authorities in China deal with that. ",
    " WPR: Great. And Chris, you have a question? ",
    " CA: Yeah, it sort of picks up on that about, you know, the stories that could come out of this. I mean, there are definitely optimistic stories that people are feeling, that this could lead to more free speech of a certain kind in China. Certain things you can't suppress. Maybe in the US it might lead to the government taking scientific predictions more seriously, not clear that's happening yet. And there's hope that this whole thing, because it's a common enemy for the world, will actually bring the world together in some ways. But I'm curious how you think about this. President Trump started referring to this as the Chinese virus. I'm curious how that's being received in China, and how people are feeling on this issue. Do you think it's increased sympathy for other countries or actually dialed up animosity? ",
    " GL: Well, it's certainly not being received well across China. I think one thing that is still really undercovered is the intensity of rising nationalism at the grassroots level across China over the last several years. And they're very protective of their country, and their people and their history. And President Trump's comments and the fact that so much of the US government is now referring to this as the Chinese virus is not received well. You know, my fear of course, is that even prior to the virus, the US-China conflict was escalating beyond anything that I think most of us as observers want to see. Trade, tech, military, ideology, and now we can add information conflict and health conflict, health tech conflict especially, to the list. Of course, the hope is that these heightened tensions will actually dissipate and that the two countries can actually, at this moment in time, choose to go down one of two paths. Either one that further damages the relationship or one that actually shows what the possibilities are if the two largest economies in the world, the two most powerful countries in the world, actually cooperate. You know, this week, Thursday is the G20 conversations that are going to happen remotely. It will be interesting to see how US and China actually coordinate, cooperate, how they communicate during those talks. ",
    " CA: I think people want to know how you think this will play out. You've got a very special seat there, you know, looking at all parts of the world in it. What's your take on how this plays out? ",
    " GL: I desperately want to be an optimist, Chris. But I think that everything we see, especially the data, shows that it is going to get far worse before it get better. And I'm very fearful for what's going on in the United States. It's because of the amount of data we have across all these different countries, you can very clearly layer countries and the way that the pandemic has been spreading, on top of one another, and we know that the US is a week and a half, maybe two weeks, behind Italy, and we know what happened in Italy and what's going on in Spain. The US is catching up on that spike and it's going to come much faster, and it's going to be much higher than I think most people originally believed or hoped for. So it will get worse. So the hope is that, again, this is going to be the optimistic side of me, that the nations will come together, that those in charge, our governments, will make the drastic, necessary moves, and we will be able to come out on the other side faster than it looks right now. Remember, when China went to shutdown, on January 23, there were only 830 confirmed cases. And even if those numbers are not exactly accurate, it's nowhere near the confirmed cases that we have in the US right now, that we see in the US. So that is something to be very, very concerned about. At 830 they shut down. And even after the shutdown, two weeks later, the cases had grown to 35,000, two weeks after that, it was at 75,000. So at this point, it is late in the US. But, we, you know \u2014 it can still be fixed. And I think most ... experts that we talk to believe that it can be fixed with fast and decisive action. ",
    " CA: Yeah, people struggle with understanding the power of exponential growth. And a number can seem smallish today, but if you believe the science, yeah, you have to act. Gary, look, I hope somehow you will convey to whomever you can convey that regardless of what some people might say, in government or elsewhere, there are millions, there are tens of millions, there are probably hundreds of millions of people in the US, on both right and left, who are amazed by what happened in China. You know, yes, missteps early on, whatever. But they're amazed, you've really \u2014 you know, both the Chinese government, the Hong Kong government, several Asian governments, Singapore, South Korea, have shown astonishingly wise and disciplined action against this thing. And we're grateful, we feel there is much we can learn from you and so \u2014 People, most people want this to be a time of bringing the world together. I genuinely believe that, it's maybe the optimistic part of me believing it. But I believe in it, it's partly what these conversations are for, to try and make those kinds of connections. We want to keep in touch. You've got an amazing seat there, and I have loved listening to every word you've said today here. It's just I've learned so much from you. So thank you for that. ",
    " GL: It was a great conversation. ",
    " WPR: Thank you for your insight. ",
    " CA: And thank you to our whole online audience, I mean, this is a journey, every day we're learning something new. And just in case anyone out there is feeling a little bit powerless, and afraid or you know, at the situation, I mean, the one thing that everyone can do right now, I think, is we can reach out to the people we know, we can encourage each of us to be our best selves in this moment. I really think it's what the world is going to need, when people are angry and fearful, we can turn into nasty people. But when we're \u2014 When we realize how much we need each other, and are willing to just reach out and share stories of hope and share what we're feeling and share possibilities, we can really impact each other, and I see so many incredible instances of that from around the world, whether it's Italians singing to each other joyfully from each other's balconies, or these sort of tales of heroism that some of our health workers have been engaged in all around the world. There's going to need to be a lot more of that. And honestly, every single person can play a part in how they are online, what they share, how they react. So I don't want to be overly, embarrassingly Kumbaya, but I kind of think we need that spirit right now a little bit. We need each other, and TED is going to try and play that role a bit. So if you hate that, maybe you don't need to be here, but I hope you don't hate that. I hope you like that and will be part of it. Whitney, it's so fun cohosting these, thanks to the rest of the amazing TED team who are everyone in our individual homes, they are sort of racing around, trying to make this stuff work technically. We're learning a bit each day, I hope. Thanks so much for being part of this. ",
    " WPR: Thank you, everyone, thank you. We'll see you all back here tomorrow. "

    " Schizophrenia was first identified  more than a century ago, but we still don\u2019t know its exact causes. It remains one of the most misunderstood  and stigmatized illnesses today. So, let\u2019s walk through what we do know\u2014  from symptoms to causes and treatments. ",
    " Schizophrenia is considered a syndrome, which means it may encompass  a number of related disorders that have similar symptoms  but varying causes. Every person with schizophrenia  has slightly different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss\u2014  subtle personality changes, irritability, or a gradual encroachment  of unusual thoughts. Patients are usually diagnosed  after the onset of psychosis, which typically occurs in the late teens  or early twenties for men and the late twenties  or early thirties for women. A first psychotic episode can feature  delusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior. These are called positive symptoms, meaning they occur  in people with schizophrenia but not in the general population. It\u2019s a common misperception  that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, but these symptoms indicate a disruption  of thought processes, rather than the manifestation  of another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are qualities that are reduced  in people with schizophrenia, such as motivation,  expression of emotion, or speech. There are cognitive symptoms as well,  like difficulty concentrating, remembering information,  and making decisions. ",
    " So what causes the onset of psychosis? There likely isn\u2019t one single cause, but a combination of genetic and environmental  risk factors that contribute. Schizophrenia has some of the strongest  genetic links of any psychiatric illness. Though about 1% of people  have schizophrenia, children or siblings of people  with schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the disease, and an identical twin  of someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being affected. Often, immediate relatives  of people with schizophrenia exhibit milder versions of traits  associated with the disorder\u2014 but not to an extent  that requires treatment. Multiple genes almost certainly  play a role, but we don\u2019t know how many, or which ones. ",
    " Environmental factors like exposure  to certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance  that someone will develop schizophrenia, and use of some drugs,  including marijuana, may trigger the onset of psychosis in highly susceptible individuals. These factors don\u2019t affect  everyone the same way. For those with very low genetic risk, no amount of exposure  to environmental risk factors will lead them to develop schizophrenia; for those with very high risk, moderate  additional risk might tip the balance. ",
    " The antipsychotic drugs used to treat  schizophrenia have helped researchers work backwards to trace signatures  of the disorder in the brain. Traditional antipsychotics  block dopamine receptors. They can be very effective  in reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess of dopamine  in particular brain pathways. But the same drugs  can make negative symptoms worse, and we\u2019ve found that negative symptoms  of schizophrenia may be tied to too little dopamine  in other brain areas. Some people with schizophrenia  show a loss of neural tissue, and it\u2019s unclear whether this atrophy  is a result of the disease itself or drug-induced suppression of signaling. Fortunately, newer generations  of antipsychotics aim to address some of these issues by targeting  multiple neurotransmitters, like serotonin in addition to dopamine. It\u2019s clear that no one transmitter system  is responsible for all symptoms, and because these drugs affect signaling  throughout the brain and body, they can have other  side effects like weight gain. ",
    " In spite of these complications,  antipsychotics can be very effective, especially when combined  with other interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy, though  it provides relatively short-lived relief, is also re-emerging  as an effective treatment, especially when other options  have failed. Early intervention  is also extremely important. After months or years  of untreated psychosis, certain psychoses can become embedded  in someone\u2019s personality. And yet, the dehumanizing stigma  attached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help. People with schizophrenia  are often perceived as dangerous, but are actually much more likely  to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators. And proper treatment may help reduce  the likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia. ",
    " That\u2019s why education\u2014 for patients,  their families, and their communities\u2014 helps erode the stigma  and improves access to treatment. "

And it seems unthinkable when you wake up and say you're going to leave a job like that to pursue a passion. And that was my dilemma six years ago. I had a comfortable job, I lived a comfortable life, and people expected me to be fulfilled, but I wasn't. There was something in me that wanted more. There was a misalignment between the things I did on a daily basis and the things that I deeply cared about. ",
    " And so I decided to quit and explore the possibility of bringing this passion into my daily routine. And the thing about finding your passion is that it's not straightforward. Even for people with money and degrees, they still struggle to identify their passion. And here I was as a 30-year-old, talking about finding my passion and turning it into a career. Literally, people told me, \"You don't talk about passion until you've made enough money \u2014 ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " or at least until you're ready to retire.\" Because there's a notion that looking inward and finding the things that give us pleasure and fulfillment is a luxury that only the rich can enjoy, or a pleasure that only the retired can indulge in. Which made me wonder: Is passion only for the rich, or an experience only the retired can enjoy? ",
    " For many of us, we've been led to believe that life is a race of survival. We've been conditioned to see ourselves as survivors that must do everything in our power to survive. In Africa, we're nurtured to go through school, cram and pass, in the hope that you get a job after. And if you do, stick at it no matter how much it sucks. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Until you get a better offer or you're asked to retire. And as a dropout, I knew that I was not entitled to anything. Every opportunity was a privilege. And so when I thought about quitting, it was a huge risk. ",
    " I was given two alternatives, which are the most popular in Africa. The first one is sign up for any course at a vocational institution and do it. My second option, settle for any job offer you can get, no matter the working conditions, and do it. That probably explains why we have so many of our young people being trafficked in search of greener pastures. ",
    " I opted for the first option. I did look at a couple vocational institutions in the hope that I would find a course that resonated with my persona, my dream and my aspiration. I was disappointed to learn that there was no room for misfits like me in these institutions. The education system in many parts of the world has been designed around preselected options that young people are expected to fit in or risk becoming misfits. And so going through school, I was nurtured and conditioned to think in the straight line and stay within the straight line. ",
    " But when I dropped out, I discovered a world of possibilities. I knew I could be anything, I could study anything, and so I leveraged free online courses. That's how I built my CV, got into employment and worked for eight years. And after eight years, I told myself there must be more to life than just going through the routines of life. ",
    " So in 2014, I started an organization called Kyusa where we are working with out-of-school youth and empowering them to turn their passions into profitable, scalable and sustainable businesses. ",
    " Now, when we talk about passion, one of the most common questions that people ask is, \"What is passion? How do I even find it?\" And in the simplest definition, passion is a collection of your life experiences that give you the deepest sense of fulfillment. And to identify your passion, you need to look inward. So we use two reflective questions. The first question we ask is, \"If you had all the time and the money in the world, what would you spend your time doing?\" It sounds like a very simple question, but many people struggle to answer this question because they've just never thought about it. ",
    " The second question we ask is, \"What makes you happy or gives you the deepest sense of fulfillment?\" Now, you would assume that we all know what makes us happy, but it's also interesting to note that so many people have no idea what makes them happy, because they are so busy going through the routines of life, they've never stopped to look inward. And so identifying the things that give us a deep sense of fulfillment and the things that give us deep joy are thoughts that begin to direct us in the direction of our passion. And just in case you're wondering what your answers are to those two questions, I invite you to sit with these questions later and just reflect about it. ",
    " However, I am also aware that passion alone cannot guarantee success in life. And I should note that not every passion can become a career. For passion to become a career, it must be coupled with the right set of skills, conditioning and positioning. So when we get our young people to look inward, we also ask them what skills do you have, what talents do you have, what experience do you have that you can use to build a niche in the marketplace. But more than that, we also look at the market trends, because it doesn't matter how much you love and enjoy it. If nobody wants it or is willing to pay for it, it can't be a career. It's just a hobby. ",
    " And the third thing we look at is how do you position yourself? Who are you targeting? Who do you want to sell to? Why would they want to buy from you? And so the combination of the three is what enables you to move from just a passion to a business. And many of our young people have been able to turn their ideas and burning desires into profitable businesses or social enterprises, and they're not just creating jobs, but they are solving societal challenges. ",
    " I'll share with you two examples. One of them is Esther. I met Esther two years ago. She had been out of school for two years, and she had been deeply affected by her dropping out. As a result, she had experienced severe depression to a point where she attempted to take her own life several times. Her friends and family didn't know what to do for her. They simply prayed for her. When I met Esther and I started to converse with her, I asked her a simple question. I said, \"If you had all the time and the money in the world, what would you do?\" Without thinking or hesitation, her eyes lit up and she began to tell me how she wanted to change the lives of young people. She wanted to restore hope and dignity to other teenagers by helping them make informed decisions about life. ",
    " I was certain of the fact that this burning desire in her was unquenchable. And so we worked with Esther to put a framework around this desire. Today, she runs a social enterprise in her village, raising awareness about substance abuse, mental health, sexual reproductive health and is helping other school dropouts acquire vocational skills, so they can make a living for themselves. Esther turned 20 this year, and for the last two years, she has organized an annual teen fest that brings together over 500 teenagers. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Young people that are able to network and collaborate on different projects, but more importantly to meet professionals they would otherwise never have met. ",
    " This is all engineered by a girl that believed the world had no room for her, that without education she would never amount to anything. But by looking inward and tapping into a burning desire, putting structure around it, it has become a model that not only changed her life but is transforming the lives of hundreds of young people every year. ",
    " My other example is Musa. Musa is a natural artistic guy. He's the kind that would look at any design and replicate it with ease. And so he seeks to recognize that ability in him. When I met Musa, he was doing all kinds of crafts \u2014 bags, belts, wallets \u2014 but it was more of a part-time thing. Or sometimes, if he was really broke and needed to make quick money, then he would come up with a design and sell it. But he had never thought of it as a business. ",
    " We started working with Musa, helping him shift his mindset from a hobby to a business and beginning to rethink how he can make products that he could sell and even be able to scale. Musa makes some of the most amazing bags I've ever seen, and over the last one year, Musa's business has grown. He has been recognized in different places. Currently, he's talking about exporting to developed countries. ",
    " Musa, like any other dropout, believed that without academic credentials, he wouldn't amount to anything. He thought the talent he had was nothing simply because he did not have an academic paper to define him. But by looking inward and finding that what he had was the greatest asset and supporting him to turn it into a business, he's not just living \u2014 he's thriving. ",
    " The thing about looking inward is that it can be scary, especially if you're doing it for the first time. But the truth is you never truly start living until you learn to live from the inside out. And in unlocking potential, we need to look inward to identify the things that give us a deep sense of fulfillment, the things that give us the deepest joy, and then weave them into the patterns of our daily routines. In so doing, we cease to work and we start to live. And the thing about living is that you never have to retire or to resign. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " And so as you think about unlocking potential for ourselves, for our young people, for our children, let's not condition them to look outward but condition them to look inward to tap into who they are and bring that self into what they do every day. ",
    " When you cease to work and you live, when passion becomes a career, you don't just excel, you become unstoppable. ",
    " Thank you. ",
    " (Applause) "

    " Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Hello and welcome to everyone joining us from around the globe. Thank you for being part of day two of our special series TED Connects. This week, we're bringing you interviews from some of the world's greatest minds to offer tools for us to navigate through and thrive in these really uncertain times. I'm Whitney Pennington Rogers, TED's current affairs curator, and I'll be one of your hosts for today's event. ",
    " Yesterday, we kicked off this series with an interview from acclaimed psychologist Susan David, who offered us some tips on how to really be our best selves in these trying times. And we're going to switch gears a little bit today from thinking about our own personal mental health to the state of our global public health systems. ",
    " Chris Anderson: Thank you. I guess we have a pretty exciting guest to introduce. On the other side of the country, let's bring in Bill Gates. Bill, they say the better-known people are, the less you have to intro them. It's great to have you here. How are you doing? ",
    " Bill Gates: I think this is an unprecedented, really disconcerting time for everyone, with things being shut down, not knowing exactly how long it's going to last, worrying about the health of all the people we care about. You know, I'm lucky that I get to connect up with video conferencing using Teams a lot, so the Foundation is stepping up and there's a lot of great people trying to help with this crisis. But it's scary for everyone. ",
    " CA: Are you basically stuck at home like many of us watching? ",
    " BG: Yeah, almost all my meetings are using Teams now, I'm getting used to that. You know, I've gone days without seeing any coworkers. ",
    " CA: Let's start here, Bill. Five years ago, you stood on the TED stage and you gave this chilling warning that the world was in danger, at some point, of a major pandemic. People watching that talk now, their hair stands up on the back of their neck \u2014 it is exactly what we're living through. What happened, did people listen to that warning at all? ",
    " BG: Basically, no. You know, I was hopeful that with the Zika and Ebola and SARS and MERS, they all reminded us that, particularly in a world where people move around so much, you can get huge devastation. And so the talk was to say, hey, we're not ready for the next pandemic, but in fact, there's advances in science that if we put resources against them, we can be ready. Sadly, very little was done. There were some things \u2014 the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, CEPI, was funded by our foundation, Wellcome Trust and a number of governments, to do some of the platform vaccine work, but in the area of diagnostics, antibodies, antivirals, basically doing the disease games that I talked about, where we'd simulate what needed to be done. We hardly did anything, and so now here we have a respiratory virus that is, sadly, fulfilling some of the more negative predictions I made. ",
    " CA: Last month, you said that this might be the big one. You wrote that this could be the sort of once-in-a-century pandemic that people had been fearing. Is that how you think of it still? ",
    " BG: Well, it's awful to say this, but we could have a respiratory virus whose case fatality rate was even higher, if this was something like smallpox, you know, that kills 30 percent of people. So this is horrific. But in fact, most people, even who get the COVID disease, are able to survive. So it's quite infectious, way more infectious than MERS or SARS were. It's not as fatal as they were. And yet, the disruption we're seeing, in order to knock it down, is really completely unprecedented. So this is going global, that was \u2014 it's respiratory, that was the great fear. How many people end up dying \u2014 hopefully, if we do the right things, it won't be a gigantic number. So, you know, we should end up not having the 1918 flu situation. We should be able to do a lot better than that. ",
    " CA: And that's because of actions that we would take. I mean, left without the right actions, the prospects are pretty deadly. If we knew what we knew in 1919, this thing could take out tens of millions of people around the world. You said \u2014 is the key thing here that it's got this sort of a strange combination of being certainly more dangerous than flu \u2014 not as dangerous as something like Ebola or SARS, but more dangerous than flu by a factor, but infectious, and also infectious before symptoms have started, is that part of why it's been really hard to respond to? ",
    " BG: Right. Ebola, you're actually flat on your back before you're very infectious. So you're not at church or in a bus or at a store. With most respiratory viruses like the flu and COVID, at first you only feel a little bit of a fever and a little bit sick, and so there's the possibility you're going about your normal activities and infecting other people. And so human-to-human transmissible respiratory viruses that in the early stage aren't stopping you from doing things, that's kind of a worst case, and that's where, you know, I did a flu simulation in the 2015 talk and showed how quickly it spread. You know, versus 1918, people move around a lot more now than they used to, and so that works against us. Now the medical system that steps up to treat people is also far, far better. ",
    " CA: But when was it clear to you that unless we acted, this could be a really deadly pandemic? ",
    " BG: Well, in January it was discussed that there was human-to-human transmission taking place. And so the alarm bells were ringing that this fits the very scary pattern that it will be very difficult to contain. And on January 23, China did their equivalent of the shutdown. Did it in a fairly extreme form. The very good news is that they were able to reduce the infection rates dramatically because of those actions. But it's January where everybody should have been on notice \u2014 let's get our act together with testing, let's get going on therapeutics and vaccines, we've got to get organized because we have this novel respiratory virus whose infectiousness and fatality put it in that superscary range. ",
    " CA: And so, what did happen? Because it's such a mystery to me about the \"lost month\" of preparations in many countries and certainly in the US, where we are. Were you on the phone to people during early February, late January, early February, saying, \"Guys, what's going on, this is a really big deal, what are we doing?\" What was happening behind the scenes during that period? ",
    " BG: Well, you'd like to have government money show up for the key activities. We put out 100 million, we created the Therapeutics Accelerator, there's the period between when we realized it was transmitting and now, where we should have done more. I think the most important thing to discuss today is that in the area of testing, we're still not creating that capacity and applying it to the people most in need. And so we have health workers who are symptomatic, who can't get a test and so they don't know should they go in or not go in, and yet we have lots of tests being given to people who aren't symptomatic. So the testing thing to me, it's got to be organized, it's got to be prioritized, that is super, super urgent. The second thing is the isolation that, you know, various parts, just focusing on the US, some parts are doing that in a fairly strong way and other parts not yet, and it's very hard to do, it's tough on people, it's disastrous for the economy. But the sooner you do it in a tough way, the sooner you can undo it and go back to normal. ",
    " CA: So we'll come to the isolation part in a minute, but just sticking with the testing thing, I'm just so confused as to why, with more than a month's notice \u2014 I mean, there are so many smart epidemiologists in the US, for example, you plug numbers about infectiousness and fatality into any simulation and you see that if you don't do anything, millions of people will die. And there's a month. So what's your explanation, what do you think happened here as to why there was almost no \u2014 a month later, there was no viable test in the US. Was this just government complexity, too many chefs in the kitchen, what on earth happened here? ",
    " BG: Well, we certainly didn't take advantage of the month of February. The good news is that the actual process, the PCR machines, we have a lot in the United States. And so there's models like South Korea, who took advantage of February, built up the testing capacity, and they were able to contact-trace and their infections have gone down, even without the type of shutdown that, because we're late, we're having to do. One thing that is good news just this week is that people had thought to do this test, that you had to have a nurse or doctor shove a swab way up, all the way to the back of your throat, which hurts a lot, but also, you're going to cough and potentially spread the disease to that health care worker. So they have to have protective equipment and change that. We sent data to the FDA this weekend, showing that just an individual, by themselves, swabbing up to the tip of their nose, the accuracy of that test is essentially the same as having a health care worker do it. That helps a lot. We still have to do other things, but that means that you don't have to change protective equipment, you just hand the patient that swab, they do it, put it in the test tube, and if the capacity is right, within 24 hours, you should get that result back. ",
    " CA: So how do you see that playing out? Are there people going to massively scale those tests and how will ordinary citizens be able to get hold of them? Does it still have to be kind of prescribed by a doctor at some point, or at some point, will you be able to order them off Amazon or something? ",
    " BG: Well, it's pretty chaotic today, because the government hasn't stepped in to make sure the testing capacity is both increased and it's used for the right cases. There will be a website \u2014 and if the federal government doesn't do it, a lot of local governments will have to do it \u2014 that you go to, you give your situation, including your symptoms, you're told, based on your work and your symptoms, are you a priority. If so, you're told where there are kiosks you can go to and you'll do the self-swab and just hand it over, or eventually, we'll send the kits to you at home, and then you'll send it back and hear that result. Maybe six months from now, you'll actually have a strip where you perform the test in the home, but for now, they're sending it back for the PCR processing. We can have massive capacity there. And that's how you know. The testing is everything, because that's how you know whether you need to do more shutdown or you're starting to get to the point where you can relieve it. ",
    " CA: Some people are trying to argue now that, almost, the testing should be dialed back, because the cat is out of the bag, testing is bringing people together and risking infection, you know, forget that, let's just focus on treatment and on isolation strategies. You disagree with that. Testing is still absolutely essential and needs to be scaled dramatically. ",
    " BG: The two that go together are testing, at very high volume, and the isolation piece. If you're a medical worker, you want to stay and do your job. If you're making sure the electricity, water, food is still available, you want to do your job, and so testing is what indicates to you, do you need to go into isolation and make sure you're not the source of spread. And so, you know, testing is the key thing. South Korea did that in this massive way that everybody should learn from. And so that is paired with the isolation piece. Our goal here is to get to the point where a very small percentage of the population is infected. You know, China, only 0.01 percent of the population was infected. If you let it, if you don't do these things, you're going to get the majority of people infected and that huge overload of the medical system. ",
    " CA: Whitney has some questions from our online audience. Whitney. ",
    " WPR: Some of the questions that we're seeing are about how our tech giants and leaders can play a role in isolating this and containing this virus. ",
    " BG: The tech companies are very involved in making sure that some work can go on. People can stay in touch, you know, they can help with some of the disease modeling, they can help with the visibility of the numbers. It's actually very impressive, you get up there and you can see those numbers. Actually, they're sad numbers, but everybody's able to monitor this thing. Back in 1918, they didn't have this type of visibility, and ability to share best practices. But for a lot of people, the isolation is the key thing. ",
    " CA: Bill, one of the riddles about this isolation strategy is how long it has to last. A lot of people are concerned that the price of victory by isolating everyone is that you crash the economy, and that we have to be, basically, at home, not doing our regular jobs for three, six months, maybe all year. And so much so that there's now this big debate in the US and other countries about this may just be the wrong strategy, that we can't crash the economy that badly, we should only isolate for another couple of weeks, and then let people back, and if that means a lot of other people get sick and we eventually build up herd immunity, that may be the right way to go. What's your thought on this, what is the isolation strategy that eventually leads to us getting back to normal? ",
    " BG: It's very tough to say to people, \"Hey, keep going to restaurants,\" you know, \"Go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner, just, you know, we want you to keep spending,\" because there's some, maybe a politician who thinks GDP growth is what really counts. It's very hard to tell people, when there's an epidemic spreading that threatens, particularly, their parents or elderly people that they know, that they should go about things knowing that their activity is spreading this disease. I don't know of any rich countries that have chosen to use that approach. It is true, if you did that approach, over a period of several years, enough people would be infected you'd have what's called herd immunity. But herd immunity is meaningless until you infect over half the population. And so you can take \u2014 You'll overload your medical system, so your case fatality rate, instead of being one percent, will be like three, four percent. And so, the idea, it's very irresponsible for somebody to suggest we can have the best of both worlds. What we need is the extreme shutdown so that in six to ten weeks, if things go well, then you can start opening back up. ",
    " CA: So just putting the math together from what you just said, Bill, to get to herd immunity, you need more than half the people in the country to basically get the bug. So in the case of the US, for example, that would be 150 million people, thereabouts. You said that the fatality rate in that scenario, you're talking about four to five million people potential fatalities. That is just a horrifying scenario that no one should be contemplating. ",
    " BG: Even one percent of the population getting sick, they will treat, whoever goes for this \"ignore the disease\" strategy, they will treat them as a pariah state, so none of their people will go in, and none of your people will go into that. And so briefly, a few countries in Europe that hadn't really looked at this hard, considered, \"OK, should we be the ones who kind of go about business as usual?\" It is tempting, because if you got there early \u2014 South Korea did not have to do the extreme shutdown, because they did such a good job on testing. ",
    " CA: Testing and containment. ",
    " BG: That's why it's so maddening to me that government is not allocating the testing to where it's needed, and maybe that will have to happen at the state level, because it's not happening at the federal level. But there is no middle course on this thing. It is sad that the shutdown will be harder for poorer countries than it is for richer countries. ",
    " CA: So let's come into that in minute. The one exception I've heard the case made for is Japan, that Japan has not contained it quite in the same way that South Korea did but has allowed people to work. It's tried to make extreme measures for protecting their most elderly population. But they've tried to find a middle scenario, haven't they? ",
    " BG: If you act \u2014 When you have hundreds of cases, you may be able to contain it by doing great testing and great contact tracing, and restricting foreigners coming in, without as much damage to your economy. The US is past this opportunity to control without shutdown. So the worst case of what was happening in Wuhan in the beginning or in northern Italy over the last few weeks, that we avoid that. But we did not act fast enough to have an ability to avoid the shutdown. ",
    " CA: But then what I don't understand, in the case of the US, for example, is that even if we're successful in bending the curve and reducing the number of new cases from a period of extreme shutdown, as it were, no immunity has been built up. Let's say that there's still no vaccine. Surely when you lift restrictions and people start going back to work, the whole thing just blows up again. ",
    " BG: The experience that we're seeing in China and in South Korea is that there are not these people who are asymptomatic that are causing lots of infections. And that's a parameter that, as you build the model, you have to put in. There's an Imperial model that people talk about a lot, which shows that reopening is very hard to do. But the results of that model are not matching what we see in China, and so very likely, there aren't as many of these infecting asymptomatics. And that's why you have to be pragmatic. There's a lot we don't know. For example, seasonality may help us in the Northern Hemisphere, the force of infection will \u2014 Respiratory viruses, to some degree, they all are seasonal. We don't know how seasonal this one is, but you know, there's a reasonable chance that the force of infection will be going down. And it's your testing that always is telling you, \"Oh, my gosh, do I have to shut down more, or can I start to open up?\" So particularly, right as you open up, that testing and contact tracing is saying to you \u2014 And you can say I'm more on the optimistic side, that it will be possible to do what China's doing, where they are starting to go back to normal. ",
    " CA: And help me understand what happened there because it seems kind of miraculous to me, because this virus was exploding, yes, in Wuhan, but people moved from there to many other parts of China. How is it possible that the combination of the shutdown in Wuhan and measures elsewhere seem to have got to the point where there are literally no new cases happening. I mean, to me, that implies that literally, the virus is not circulating at all between humans in China. You know, there's a few tourists coming in who they deal with, but I mean, is that literally your interpretation of what happened, that it's no longer circulating in China? ",
    " BG: Absolutely. Take a spreadsheet and take a number like four \u2014 one person infects four people \u2014 and say the cycle is every 10 days. Go through eight of those cycles, and you're getting the big number. You know, start with 10,000 and then, you know, that increase. If you take the number 0.4 instead, that is, the average case infects 0.4 people, then look at what happens to that number as you go out. It drops to zero, and so things that are exponential are very, very dramatic. When they're above one, they are growing rapidly. When they're below one, they are shrinking rapidly. And so the isolation in China drove that reproductive number to well below zero. And so local infection rates \u2014 ",
    " CA: Below one. ",
    " BG: Below one, sorry. And that quarantine, you know, quarantine comes from \"40 days,\" which is what they thought would help for black plague, that is our primary technique. Thank God we have testing, if we use it properly. We are doing therapeutics, which will help with the death rate, but in terms of keeping the infections below one percent of the population, it really all depends just on the two things: isolation and testing. ",
    " CA: So to quote a question from my Twitter feed this morning for you Bill: If you were president for a month in the US, what would be the top two or three things you would do? ",
    " BG: Well, the clear message that we have no choice to maintain this isolation and that's going to keep going for a period of time, you know, probably in the Chinese case, it was like six weeks, so we have to prepare ourselves for that, and do it very well. And then use the testing and every week, talk about what's going on with that. If you're doing isolation well, within about 20 days, you'll see those numbers really change, you know, instead of this, you'll see this, and that is a sign that you're on your way. Now, you have to stay to get more generations that are 0.4 infections per previous infection. You have to maintain it for a number of weeks there. And you know, so this is not going to be easy. We need a clear message about that. It is really tragic that the economic effects of this are very dramatic. I mean, nothing like this has ever happened to the economy in our lifetimes. But bringing the economy back and doing money, that's more of a reversible thing than bringing people back to life. And so, we're going to take the pain in the economic dimension, huge pain, in order to minimize the pain in the disease and death dimension. ",
    " CA: Whitney. ",
    " WPR: We have a lot of other questions coming in. One that we've been seeing is a question about what tools are available for countries that maybe don't have the luxury of being able to social-distance, don't have great health systems in place, how should they be handling this virus? ",
    " BG: Yeah, I would say, if the rich countries really do their job well, by the summer, they'll be like China is, or some of the other countries that responded early. But in the developing countries, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, the seasonality is large. As you say, the ability to isolate, you know, when you go out to get your food every day, you have to earn your wage, when you live in a slum or you're very nearby each other, it's very hard to do, as you move down the income ladder, than it is for a country like the United States. And so we should all accelerate the vaccine, which eventually will come, and you know, people are being responsible to say that that's going to take 18 months. And there's a lot of those being pursued. I'm talking a lot with Seth Berkley, who you're going to have later this week, who can talk a lot about the vaccine front, because he's definitely at the center of that, being the head of GAVI. We do need to get really cheap testing out to these countries, and we need to get therapeutics so you don't need to put five percent of people on respirators. Because even if they had the equipment, they don't have the personnel, they just don't have the beds, the capacity. And so the only good news is that the rich countries have this and so they will be learning about testing, therapeutics, and funding the vaccines for the entire world, to try and minimize the damage in developing countries. ",
    " WPR: Great, I'll be back later with more questions. ",
    " CA: Bill, you mentioned therapeutics there. What is looking promising, is anything looking promising? ",
    " BG: Yeah, so there's quite a range of things going on. There's a few that get mentioned a lot, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and the data is still a bit confusing, but there's some positive data on those. Remdesivir is a five-day IV infusion, and actually kind of hard to manufacture, so people are looking at how that can be improved. The hydroxychloroquine looks like it works, somewhat, if you get in early. There's a huge list of compounds, including antibodies, antiviral drugs, and so the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust, with support from Mastercard and now others, created this therapeutics accelerator to really triage out. You have hundreds of people showing up and saying, try this, try that. So we look at lab assays, animal models, and so we understand which things should be prioritized for these very quick human trials that need to be done all over the world. So the coordination on that is very complex, globally. But I think, you know, out of the top 20 or so candidates, probably three or four of them will work out, you know, at different stages of the disease, to reduce the respiratory distress. ",
    " CA: I heard you mentioned that one possibility might be treatments from the serum, the blood serum, of people who had had the disease and recovered. So I guess they're carrying antibodies. Talk a bit about that, how that could work and what it would take to accelerate that. ",
    " BG: Yeah, this has always been discussed as how could you pull that off. So people who are recovered, it appears, have really effective antibodies in their blood. So you could go, transfuse them and only take out the white cells, the immune cells. And then the question is, OK, how many patients' worth of material could you get? You know, if you have that recovered person come in, say, once a week, do you get enough for two people or five people? Then logistically, you have to take that and get it to where that need is. And so it's fairly complicated, you know, compared to a drug that we can make in high volume. You know, the cost of taking it out and putting it back in probably doesn't scale as well. But there is work being done on this. You know, we actually started with Ebola, and fortunately, it got done before it was needed. So that is being pursued and it will work to some degree, but it will be hard to scale the numbers. ",
    " CA: So it's almost like, when you talk about the need to accelerate testing, the immediate need is for testing for the virus. But is it possible that in a few months' time, there's going to be this growing need to test for these antibodies in people, i.e. to see if someone had the disease and recovered, maybe they didn't even know they had it. Because you could picture this growing worldwide force of heroes \u2014 let's call them heroes \u2014 who have been through this experience and have a lot to offer the world. Maybe they can offer blood donation, serum donation. But also other tasks, like, if you've got overwhelmed health care systems, presumably, there are kind of community health worker type tasks that people could be trained to do to relieve the pressure there, if we knew that they were effectively immune? ",
    " BG: Yes. Until we came up with the self-swab and showed FDA that that's equivalent, we were thinking that people who might be able to man those kiosks would be the recovered patients. Now we don't want to have a lot of recovered people, you know. To be clear, we're trying, through the shutdown, in the United States, to not get to one percent of the population infected. We're well below that today, but with exponentiation, you could get past that three million. I believe we will be able to avoid that with having this economic pain. Eventually, what we'll have to have is certificates of who is a recovered person, who is a vaccinated person, because you don't want people moving around the world \u2014 where you'll have some countries that won't have it under control, sadly \u2014 you don't want to completely block off the ability for those people to go there and come back and move around. ",
    " CA: Bill, is your foundation helping to accelerate the manufacture of these self tests? What are the prospects for really seeing scale on some of this testing soon, not just in the US, but globally? ",
    " BG: Yeah, our foundation, we'd been funding the thing called the Flu Study to really understand how respiratory viruses spread. It's amazing how little was understood about how important schools are, different age groups, different types of interaction. And that gave us an experience. In fact, that flu study actually was the first time coronavirus was found in the community, because the government was still saying you only test people who'd come from China, but we ran into people who had coronavirus, who hadn't been travelers. So, that was like an early warning sign, even though the regulation said you weren't supposed to even look at that. So yeah, the Foundation is working with all the private sector people, the diagnostics people on this testing piece. Now that we can do the self-swab, those swabs are very easy to manufacture. The one where you had to jam it into the throat, deep turbinate, that was getting into short supply. So the swab should not be limiting, neither should the various chemicals that help run the PCR machines. So we should be able to get to a South Korea-type prioritized testing thing within a few weeks. ",
    " CA: How important is it that the world's nations collaborate right now? I mean, it seems like, you know, here's this common enemy facing humanity, it does not know that it just crossed a border, it does not know what race people are, what religion they are \u2014 it just knows, \"Here's a human, I've got a manufacturing machine here that can make me famous.\" And it goes to work. It's so terrifying to me to see signs of countries starting to blame each other or the xenophobia, it just seems so toxic. What's your take on this, Bill? Do you see signs of cooperation happening, or are you also worried about the sort of, \"US versus China\" kind of thing that seems to be going on if we're not careful? ",
    " BG: Well, I see both. I see that countries that are recovered can help other countries. And that's fantastic. If by the summer, we've knocked this thing down, then great, we can help other countries. There are vaccine projects all over the world, and those should be evaluated on a very neutral basis, to which one is the best to help humanity. And make sure the manufacturing capacity isn't just for rich countries, that it's scaled up, very low cost stuff for the entire world, and that's the spirit of GAVI, is getting vaccines out to every person. So in the science side, and data-sharing side, you see this great cooperation going on. Unfortunately, whenever you have disease, this sense of other and foreign and \"Oh, stay away from me,\" you know, that sort of pulling inward is reinforced. And we have to avoid that. You know, ironically, we have to isolate physically, while in terms of looking at community groups that are pooling resources to help make sure food gets to everyone and help assure medical care, you know, if older people need to be moved out of common facilities, you help out with that, and that people aren't suffering too much from the psychology of isolation. So our generosity has to go up towards others at the same time we're less actually physically interacting with other people. ",
    " CA: I mean, thinking about the situation in many developing countries, I'm curious how you think of this. You mentioned, first of all, that seasonality may help, i.e. high temperatures. Is it possible that that is so far protecting, to some extent, places like India or sub-Saharan Africa and so forth? ",
    " BG: India's Northern Hemisphere. So Southern Hemisphere is lots of Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia. And it is true, either the force of the infection is lower there or we're just not seeing it with testing. You know, a few months from now, we'll understand the seasonality question, which would be good news for the Northern Hemisphere, and somewhat bad news for the Southern Hemisphere. Now more people live in the Northern Hemisphere, including India, Pakistan, and that would buy us some time, and time is a big deal, because all these tools get so much better if you had to go into a second season with it. But yeah, sadly, we could see, in the next few months, as the Southern Hemisphere is moving into its fall and then winter, we could see a big increase there, and that is going to be very difficult. Now they don't have as many older people, but they have lots of people who are HIV positive, or have malnutrition or various lung challenges because of indoor smoke, and so the wild card is how well can the developing countries deal with this. ",
    " CA: If you're in a country where the majority of your population is making less than two or three dollars a day, can you even afford a strategy that looks like, basically, shutting down the economy? ",
    " BG: I'm very worried that there will be a massive number of deaths in those poorer countries, because the health systems just aren't \u2014 you know, the number of respirators, hospitals, and of course, when you overload that system, your deaths are not just COVID deaths, but everyone else who's trying to access a system that will be somewhat in chaos, including with health workers who are getting sick. ",
    " CA: OK, we're getting near to running out of time with this. Whitney, maybe a last question or two from online. ",
    " WPR: Sure, we have two from online, we're seeing thousands of questions around these same lines. One, there's lots of people who are really interested to hear about the kind of work that you're doing with your foundation as far as distributing tests, but also producing safety gear, masks and that sort of thing, to help with this effort for health workers. ",
    " BG: So the Gates Foundation, you know, we, very early on, gave out 100 million to help out with all the pieces: the testing piece, the therapeutics and the vaccines. We are not experts in making masks and ventilators and gowns, and it's great that other people, including some 3D printing, and open-source things, that is great. Our focus, you know, like this self-swab thing, nobody had done that before, people thought it wouldn't work, we were quite sure it would work. And so that, for the globe, is a huge thing. We work a lot with both governments and private sector, so in some ways, we're kind of a bridge. And we've been talking to the heads of the pharmaceutical companies, the testing companies and, specifically, with the ones doing vaccines, including some of which are these new type of vaccines, RNA vaccines, that we've been backing for quite some time, and CEPI has been backing. And so our expertise is in those medical tools and really getting the best of the private sector engaged there. It's been a little slow. We can write checks right away, whereas the government processes, even in this situation \u2014 you know, there's still this notion of bidding, and not really knowing who has the unique capabilities of doing things, and so, an organization that's working on this all the time, lots of new vaccines, can step in and be helpful. And it's really amazing. When we talk to private-sector partners, their interest in helping out has been absolutely fantastic. And so that's where we have a unique role. ",
    " WPR: And the other question that we're seeing a ton of \u2014 before we wrap up here \u2014 is just people are really interested in your insight, Bill, on whether you think we are heading in the right direction, do you feel like our economy is heading in the right place, that humanity is heading in the right place, are we in a better position now than you thought we were in five years ago? ",
    " BG: Well, five years ago, I said that pandemic is this unaddressed, very, very scary thing. And that if we did the right things, we could be more prepared. Science is on our side. The fact we can be ready for the next epidemic, it's very clear how to do that. And yes, it will take tens of billions, but not hundreds or trillions of dollars. So it will be tiny compared to the economic cost. I remember when I did that presentation 2015, I put up, \"Hey, a big flu epidemic could cost four trillion,\" and I thought, wow, that's a big number, do I really think it's that big? And I went and looked up numbers and thought, yeah, well, that's big. This epidemic will cost that much to the economy. So in the short run, we are going to have more pain and more difficulty and people are going to have to step up to help each other. I'm still very much an optimist, you know, whether it's climate change, countries working together, biology taking the diseases, malaria, TB, you know, even advances for what are more rich-world diseases, like cancer. The amount of innovation, the way we can connect up and work together \u2014 yes, I'm superpositive about that. You know, I love my work because I see progress on all these diseases all the time. Now we have to turn and focus on this, you know. Sadly, it may interrupt and the polio situation might get worse a little bit because of the distraction here. We're using a lot of the great capacity that was built up for those polio activities to try and help the developing countries respond to this very well. And that is appropriate, but the message from me, although it's very sober when we're dealing with this epidemic, you know, I'm very positive that this should draw us together. We will get out of this, and then, we will get ready for the next epidemic. ",
    " CA: That's exactly what I was going to ask you, Bill, which is, where is your head, do you think we will get through this? Will the leaders that matter listen to the scientists, will they? Will we make it through? Do you believe that within a few months' time, we're already going to be looking back and saying, \"Phew, we dodged a pretty bad one there.\" ",
    " BG: We can't say for sure that even the rich countries will be out of this in six to ten weeks. I think that's likely, but as we get the testing data, we'll get more of a sense of that and people will continuously be able to see that. But you know, the rich countries will get out of this. The developing countries will bear a significant price, but even they, we will get a vaccine and GAVI will get that out to everyone. So you know, two to three years from now, this thing, even on a global basis, will essentially be over with a gigantic price tag. But now we're going to know, OK, next time we see a pathogen, we can make billions of tests within two or three weeks. We can figure out which antiviral drugs work within two or three weeks and get those scaled up. And we can make a vaccine, if we're really ready, probably in six months, using these new platforms, probably the RNA vaccine. So specifically, there are innovations that are there that will get financed, you know, I hope, quite generously, coming out of this thing. And so, three years from now, we'll look back and say, you know, that was awful, there's a lot of heroes, but we've learned a lesson and the world as a whole, with its great science and desire to help each other, was able to try and minimize what happened there and avoid it happening again. ",
    " CA: That's certainly the optimistic scenario that I'm craving for, myself. That the world kind of realizes, one, that there are certain things that you just have to unite on. Two, that science really matters and it's a miracle that science can understand this bug, you know, make a vaccine, sequence it, make therapeutics, understand how to model it \u2014 it's kind of miraculous to me. So will we learn, now, to pay attention to scientists, because if we do, I'm sure that you feel this as well, there's an amazing analogue with climate, it's just a different timescale. That the scientists are out there, saying, \"There's this huge enemy coming, if we do nothing, it's going to take millions of lives, it's going to wreck our planet. For God's sake, act, politicians! Do something.\" And the politicians are going, \"Meh, no. We need a little more GDP, we need to win an election.\" And they're not acting. Do you see a scenario where this shocks politicians to actually change their thinking and their prioritization of science overall, or is that asking too much? ",
    " BG: Yeah, it's interesting how much of this distraction will delay the urgent innovation agenda that exists over in climate. You know, I have freed up a lot of time to work on climate. I have to say, you know, for the last few months, that's now shifted, and until we get out of this crisis, COVID will dominate, and so some of the climate stuff, although it will still go on, it won't get that same focus. As we get past this, yes, that idea of innovation and science and the world working together, that is totally common between these two problems. And so I don't think this has to be a huge setback for climate. ",
    " CA: Last question. There are thousands of people watching, many of them living alone, some quite scared, there may even be people there who have this virus and are suffering symptoms or recovering. By the way, if that's you, we'd love to hear from you, we really would. Maybe have a conversation with some of you, in a future one of these, just understanding the experience. But Bill, what can people do as individuals from their own homes, right now, to try and help? ",
    " BG: Well, there's a lot of creativity, you know \u2014 can you mentor kids who are being forced into an online format where the school systems really weren't ready for that? Can you organize some giving activity that gets the food banks to step up where there's problems there? These are such unprecedented times, and it really should draw out that sense of creativity, while complying with the isolation mandates. ",
    " CA: Bill, I really want to thank you for spending this time with us and for the financial investment, the time investment. You've really invested your life into trying to solve these big problems. And this is as big as they get. I have a hunch that your voice is really going to be needed in the next few weeks. Thank you so much for your time today. This was really wonderful, hearing from you. Thank you. ",
    " BG: Thanks, Chris. ",
    " CA: OK, thanks, everyone, thanks for being part of the TED community. Look after yourselves, be smart about this. You know, get ahead of it. If you're in a part of the world where this thing hasn't really hit, listen to Bill Gates. Get ahead of it. Keep, you know, if you possibly can, socially distanced. No, not \u2014 physically distanced and socially connect. That's what the internet is for. These days are what the internet was built for. We can spread love, we can spread ideas, we can spread relationship, we can spread thought, without spreading a dangerous bug. So get ahead of it, and let's figure this out together. It's been wonderful spending time with you. From Whitney and from me and from the whole TED team, thank you, and over and out. "

    " I'm an immigrant from Venezuela, and I've lived in the US for six years. If you ask me about my life as an expatriate, I would say that I've been lucky. But it hasn't been easy. ",
    " Growing up, I never thought that I was going to leave my homeland. I participated in my first student protest in 2007, when the president shut down one of the most important news networks. I was getting my bachelor's degree in communications, and that was the first time I realized I couldn't take free speech for granted. ",
    " We knew things were getting bad, but we never saw what was coming: an economic crisis, infrastructure breaking down, citywide electrical blackouts, the decline of public health care and shortage of medicines, disease outbreaks and starvation. I moved to Canada with my husband in 2013, and we always thought we'd move back home when the crisis improved. But we never did. Nearly all my childhood friends have left the country, but my parents are still there. There have been moments where I've called my mom, and I could hear people screaming and crying in the background as teargas bombs exploded in the streets. And my mom, as if I couldn't hear it, would always tell me, ",
    " (Speaking Spanish) ",
    " \"We're fine, don't worry.\" But of course, I worry. It's my parents, and I'm 4,000 miles away. ",
    " Today, I'm just one of more than four million Venezuelans who have left their home country. A lot of my friends are Venezuelan immigrants, and in the last few years, we've begun talking about how we could make a difference when we live so far away. That is how Code for Venezuela was born in 2019. ",
    " It began with a hackathon, because we are experts in tech, and we thought we could use our tech skills to create solutions for people on the ground. But first, we needed to find some experts actually living inside Venezuela to guide us. We'd see so many other hackathons that came up with wily, ambitious, incredible technological solutions that sounded great in theory but ultimately failed to work in the actual countries they were intended to help. Many of us have been living abroad for years, and we are detached from the day-to-day problems that people are facing in Venezuela. So we turned to the experts actually living inside of the country. ",
    " For example, Julio Castro, a doctor and one of the leaders of M\u00e9dicos por la Salud. When the government stopped publishing official health care data in 2015, Dr. Julio began collecting information himself, using an informal but coordinated system of cell phone communications. They track available personnel, medical supplies, mortality data, disease outbreaks; compile it into a report; and then share that on Twitter. He became our go-to expert on health care in Venezuela. ",
    " Luis Carlos D\u00edaz, a widely recognized journalist who reports acts of censorship and human rights violations suffered by the people of Venezuela, he helps us make sense of what is happening there, since the news is controlled by the government. ",
    " We call these people our heroes on the ground. With their expert advice, we came up with a series of challenges for hackathon participants. In that first hackathon, we had 300 participants from seven countries come up with 16 different project submissions. We picked the projects with the most potential and continued working on them after the event. Today, I'll share two of our most successful projects to give you a taste of the impact we are having so far. They're called MediTweet and Blackout Tracker. ",
    " MediTweet is an intelligent Twitter bot that helps Venezuelans find the medicine they need. Right now in Venezuela, if you get sick and you go to a hospital, there is a good chance they won't have the right medical supplies to treat you. The situation is so bad that patients often get a \"shopping list\" from the doctor instead of a prescription. ",
    " I live the need for this firsthand. My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. She needed to have a lumbar puncture to get a final diagnosis and treatment plan. But the needle for this procedure wasn't available. I was in Venezuela at that time, and I was seeing my mom getting worse in front of me every day. After looking everywhere, we found the needle in a site that is like the eBay of Latin America. I met the seller in a local bakery, and it was like buying something on the black market. My mom brought the needle to her doctor, and he did the procedure. Without this, she could have died. ",
    " But it's not just medical supplies, it's medicines, too. When she was first diagnosed, we bought her treatment in a state pharmacy, and it was, like, practically free. But then the state pharmacy ran out, and we still had six months of treatment ahead. Six months of treatment ahead. We bought some medicines online and the rest in Mexico. Now she's in her third year of remission, and every time that I call, she tells me, \"I'm fine, don't worry.\" ",
    " But not everyone can afford to leave the country, and many aren't healthy enough to travel. That is why people turn to Twitter, buying and selling medicines using the hashtag #ServicioPublico, meaning \"public service.\" Our Twitter bot scans Twitter for the hashtag #ServicioPublico and connects users who are asking for specific medicines with those who are selling their private leftovers. We also pool the location data of those Twitter users and use it for a visualization tool. It gives local organizations like M\u00e9dicos por la Salud a sense of where they have a shortage. We can also apply machine learning algorithms to detect clusters of disease. If they've received humanitarian aid, this could help them to make better decisions about the distributions of the supplies. ",
    " Our second project, is called Blackout Tracker. Venezuela is currently going through an electricity crisis. Last year, Venezuela suffered what some people consider the worst power failures in Venezuelan history. I had two long days without communication with my parents. Some cities experienced blackouts every day. But you only know about this on social media. The government won't report blackouts on the news. When the power goes out, many Venezuelans, we quickly tweet out the location with the hashtag #SinLuz, meaning \"without electricity,\" before their phones ran out of battery, so people around the country know what is happening. Like MediTweet, Blackout Tracker scans Twitter for the hashtag #SinLuz and creates a map using the location data of those users. You can quickly see where the blackouts are happening today and how many blackouts have happened over time. ",
    " People want to know what is happening, and this is our answer. But it's also a way of holding the government accountable. It's easy for them to deny that the problem exists or make excuses, because there is no official data on it. Blackout Tracker shows how bad the problem really is. ",
    " Now, some people in Silicon Valley may look at these projects and say that there are no major technological innovations. But that is the point. These projects are not insanely advanced, but it's what the people of Venezuela need, and they can have a tremendous impact. Beyond these projects, perhaps our most significant accomplishment is that a movement has been created, one where people around the world are coming together to use their professional skills to create solutions for the people of Venezuela. And because we are partnering with locals, we are creating the solutions that people want and need. ",
    " What is so great about this is that we are using our professional skills, so it comes easily and naturally. It's not that hard for us to make a difference. If someone from San Francisco were to hire professionals to create solutions like MediTweet or Blackout Tracker, it would cost a small fortune. By donating our services, we are making a bigger impact than if we were just to donate money. ",
    " And you can do the same thing \u2014 not in Venezuela, necessarily, but in your own community. In a world that is more connected than ever, we still see how specialized communities can be living isolated or in silos. There are so many great ways to help, but I believe that you can use your professional skills to connect diverse communities and create effective solutions through those relationships. ",
    " Anyone with knowledge and professional skills has a powerful force to bring hope to a community. For us at Code for Venezuela, this is just the beginning. ",
    " Thank you. ",
    " (Applause) "

    " In January of 1953, a tidal surge  shook the North Sea. The titanic waves flooded  the Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm  threatened the region. But this time, the Netherlands  were ready. As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors  activated emergency protocols. Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms  swung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm  with the shifting wind and waves. By morning, the storm had passed  with minimal flooding. The first field activation  of the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. ",
    " As one of the planet\u2019s largest mobile  structures, this storm surge barrier  is a marvel of human engineering. But the Maeslantkering is just one part of a massive, interlocking system of water controls  known as the Delta Works\u2014 the most sophisticated flood prevention  project in the world. ",
    " The Netherlands has a long history  with water management. The country lies along the delta  of three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory  is below sea level. This geography makes the region  extremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest  Dutch governing bodies were informal \u201cwater boards\u201d that  coordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch government took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting  the entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds  of flooding below 1 in 10,000\u2014 about 100 times as safe as the average coastal city. ",
    " Accomplishing this lofty goal required various infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense was to dam  the region\u2019s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of  the country\u2019s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed  flood water to surge inland. Using a series of dams, the Delta  Commission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve  as nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn\u2019t work  for the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping  industry, this passage had to be kept open  in safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible  protection necessary. ",
    " Alongside additional barriers,  like grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk  of the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on  holding back ocean storms. But in the following decades,  the Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works  and protect against floods further inland. Under the \"Room for the River\" plan, farms and dikes were relocated  away from the shore. This left more space for water  to collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats  for local wildlife. This strategic retreat not only  decreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped  settlements to be built more densely and sustainably. ",
    " Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands'  multi-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city  almost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts  are protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts  have been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs  that store rainwater. Numerous structures around the city  transform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters  and sports arenas. Meanwhile in the harbor, floating  pavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several planned  amphibious structures, some of which house water purification systems and solar collectors. ",
    " These strategies are just some  of the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands  at the cutting edge of water management. The country continues to find new ways  to make cities more resilient to natural disasters. And as the rising sea levels  caused by climate change threaten low-lying cities  across the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional  example of how to go with the flow. "

    " In the future, self-driving cars will be safer and more reliable than humans. But for this to happen, we need technologies that allow cars to respond faster than humans, we need algorithms that can drive better than humans and we need cameras that can see more than humans can see. ",
    " For example, imagine a self-driving car is about to make a blind turn, and there's an oncoming car or perhaps there's a child about to run into the street. Fortunately, our future car will have this superpower, a camera that can see around corners to detect these potential hazards. ",
    " For the past few years as a PhD student in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab, I've been working on a camera that can do just this \u2014 a camera that can image objects hidden around corners or blocked from direct line of sight. ",
    " So let me give you an example of what our camera can see. This is an outdoor experiment we conducted where our camera system is scanning the side of this building with a laser, and the scene that we want to capture is hidden around the corner behind this curtain. So our camera system can't actually see it directly. And yet, somehow, our camera can still capture the 3D geometry of this scene. ",
    " So how do we do this? The magic happens here in this camera system. You can think of this as a type of high-speed camera. Not one that operates at 1,000 frames per second, or even a million frames per second, but a trillion frames per second. So fast that it can actually capture the movement of light itself. And to give you an example of just how fast light travels, let's compare it to the speed of a fast-running comic book superhero who can move at up to three times the speed of sound. It takes a pulse of light about 3.3 billionths of a second, or 3.3 nanoseconds, to travel the distance of a meter. Well, in that same time, our superhero has moved less than the width of a human hair. That's pretty fast. But actually, we need to image much faster if we want to capture light moving at subcentimeter scales. So our camera system can capture photons at time frames of just 50 trillionths of a second, or 50 picoseconds. ",
    " So we take this ultra-high-speed camera and we pair it with a laser that sends out short pulses of light. Each pulse travels to this visible wall and some light scatters back to our camera, but we also use the wall to scatter light around the corner to the hidden object and back. We repeat this measurement many times to capture the arrival times of many photons from different locations on the wall. And after we capture these measurements, we can create a trillion-frame-per-second video of the wall. ",
    " While this wall may look ordinary to our own eyes, at a trillion frames per second, we can see something truly incredible. We can actually see waves of light scattered back from the hidden scene and splashing against the wall. And each of these waves carries information about the hidden object that sent it. So we can take these measurements and pass them into a reconstruction algorithm to then recover the 3D geometry of this hidden scene. ",
    " Now I want to show you one more example of an indoor scene that we captured, this time with a variety of different hidden objects. And these objects have different appearances, so they reflect light differently. For example, this glossy dragon statue reflects light differently than the mirror disco ball or the white discus thrower statue. And we can actually see the differences in the reflected light by visualizing it as this 3D volume, where we've just taken the video frames and stacked them together. And time here is represented as the depth dimension of this cube. ",
    " These bright dots that you see are reflections of light from each of the mirrored facets of the disco ball, scattering against the wall over time. The bright streaks of light that you see arriving soonest in time are from the glossy dragon statue that's closest to the wall, and the other streaks of light come from reflections of light from the bookcase and from the statue. ",
    " Now, we can also visualize these measurements frame by frame, as a video, to directly see the scattered light. And again, here we see, first, reflections of light from the dragon, closest to the wall, followed by bright dots from the disco ball and other reflections from the bookcase. And finally, we see the reflected waves of light from the statue. These waves of light illuminating the wall are like fireworks that last for just trillionths of a second. And even though these objects reflect light differently, we can still reconstruct their shapes. And this is what you can see from around the corner. ",
    " Now, I want to show you one more example that's slightly different. In this video, you see me dressed in this reflective suit and our camera system is scanning the wall at a rate of four times every second. The suit is reflective, so we can actually capture enough photons that we can see where I am and what I'm doing, without the camera actually directly imaging me. By capturing photons that scatter from the wall to my tracksuit, back to the wall and back to the camera, we can capture this indirect video in real time. ",
    " And we think that this type of practical non-line-of-sight imaging could be useful for applications including for self-driving cars, but also for biomedical imaging, where we need to see into the tiny structures of the body. And perhaps we could also put similar camera systems on the robots that we send to explore other planets. ",
    " Now you may have heard about seeing around corners before, but what I showed you today would have been impossible just two years ago. For example, we can now image large, room-sized hidden scenes outdoors and at real-time rates, and we've made significant advancements towards making this a practical technology that you could actually see on a car someday. ",
    " But of course, there's still challenges remaining. For example, can we image hidden scenes at long distances where we're collecting very, very few photons, with lasers that are low-power and that are eye-safe. Or can we create images from photons that have scattered around many more times than just a single bounce around the corner? Can we take our prototype system that's, well, currently large and bulky, and miniaturize it into something that could be useful for biomedical imaging or perhaps a sort of improved home-security system, or can we take this new imaging modality and use it for other applications? I think it's an exciting new technology and there could be other things that we haven't thought of yet to use it for. ",
    " And so, well, a future with self-driving cars may seem distant to us now \u2014 we're already developing the technologies that could make cars safer and more intelligent. And with the rapid pace of scientific discovery and innovation, you never know what new and exciting capabilities could be just around the corner. ",

    " 4,300 years ago  in ancient Sumer, the most powerful person in the city of Ur was banished to wander the vast desert. ",
    " Her name was Enheduanna. She was the high priestess of the moon god and history\u2019s first known author. By the time of her exile, she had written  42 hymns and three epic poems\u2014 and Sumer hadn\u2019t heard the last of her. ",
    " Enheduanna lived 1,700 years  before Sappho, 1,500 years before Homer, and about 500 years before  the biblical patriarch Abraham. She was born in Mesopotamia, the land  between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the birthplace of the first cities  and high cultures. Her father was King Sargon the Great,  history\u2019s first empire builder, who conquered the independent city-states  of Mesopotamia under a unified banner. Sargon was a northern Semite  who spoke Akkadian, and the older Sumerian cities in the south viewed him as a foreign invader. They frequently revolted to regain  their independence, fracturing his new dynasty. ",
    " To bridge the gap between cultures, Sargon appointed his only daughter,  Enheduanna, as high priestess in the empire\u2019s most important temple. Female royalty traditionally  served religious roles, and she was educated to read  and write in both Sumerian and Akkadian, and make mathematical calculations. ",
    " The world's first writing started in Sumer as a system of accounting, allowing merchants to communicate  over long distances with traders abroad. Their pictogram system of record keeping  developed into a script about 300 years  before Enheduanna\u2019s birth. This early writing style,  called cuneiform, was written with a reed stylus pressed  into soft clay to make wedge-shaped marks. But until Enheduanna, this writing mostly took the form  of record keeping and transcription, rather than original works attributable  to individual writers. ",
    " Enheduanna\u2019s Ur was a city  of 34,000 people with narrow streets, multi-storied brick homes, granaries,  and irrigation. As high priestess, Enheduanna  managed grain storage for the city, oversaw hundreds of temple workers,  interpreted sacred dreams, and presided over the monthly  new moon festival and rituals celebrating the equinoxes. ",
    " Enheduanna set about unifying  the older Sumerian culture with the newer Akkadian civilization. To accomplish this,  she wrote 42 religious hymns that combined both mythologies. Each Mesopotamian city  was ruled by a patron deity, so her hymns were dedicated  to the ruling god of each major city. She praised the city\u2019s temple,  glorified the god\u2019s attributes, and explained the god\u2019s relationship  to other deities within the pantheon. In her writing,  she humanized the once aloof gods\u2014 now they suffered, fought, loved,  and responded to human pleading. ",
    " Enheduanna\u2019s most valuable  literary contribution was the poetry she wrote to Inanna,  goddess of war and desire, the divinely chaotic energy  that gives spark to the universe. Inanna delighted in all forms  of sexual expression and was considered so powerful that  she transcended gender boundaries, as did her earthly attendants, who could  be prostitutes, eunuchs or cross-dressers. ",
    " Enheduanna placed Inanna at the top of  the pantheon as the most powerful deity. Her odes to Inanna mark the first time  an author writes using the pronoun \u201cI,\u201d and the first time writing is used  to explore deep, private emotions. ",
    " After the death of Enheduanna\u2019s father,  King Sargon, a general took advantage  of the power vacuum and staged a coup. As a powerful member of the ruling family, Enheduanna was a target, and the general exiled her from Ur. Her nephew,  the legendary Sumerian king Naram-Sin, ultimately crushed the uprising  and restored his aunt as high priestess. ",
    " In total, Enheduanna served  as high priestess for 40 years. After her death,  she became a minor deity, and her poetry was copied, studied,  and performed throughout the empire for over 500 years. Her poems influenced  the Hebrew Old Testament, the epics of Homer, and Christian hymns. Today, Enheduanna\u2019s legacy still exists, on clay tablets that have  stood the test of time. "

    " OK. So we are going to start in 1891, when a German scientist was looking through a microscope at insect cells. And he saw something kind of funny. At the center of the cells, there was this dark stuff. No one had ever seen it before. And he noticed that as the cells would multiply and divide, it would go into some of the new cells but not the others. He didn't know what it was, so he gave it a really great name. He called it the \"X element.\" ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " And he was like, \"We'll just fill in that X later.\" ",
    " And then, fast-forward 10 years later, and there is an American scientist, and she is looking through her microscope, also at insect cells. And she sees something funny. There's more of this dark stuff. And it's kind of tiny, it's hanging out near the X element. And eventually, someone was like, \"Well, if that one thing's called X, should we call this other thing Y?\" And like that, (Snaps fingers) the sex chromosomes had been discovered. ",
    " So chromosomes, you probably all know what they are, but I will tell you anyways. They're made up of DNA \u2014 everything has it, it's the blueprint of life, we've got rats, we've got trees, we've got insects, we've got humans. And in the case of human chromosomes, geneticist Melissa Wilson broke it down for me like this. ",
    " (Audio) Melissa Wilson: Typically, you'll get one copy of every chromosome from your genetic mom and one copy of every chromosome from your genetic dad, and we have 22 of these that you get one copy from mom and one copy from dad. And then there's a 23rd pair, X and Y. ",
    " Molly Webster: So while all the other chromosomes are numbered, one through 22, we do not call X and Y 23. I like to think that they are waiting for, like, a LeBron James to come along. But in this instance, they were like, \"We're just going to keep the letters, and then we'll give them a title.\" They called them the sex chromosomes. Now I would wager that in the United States, these are the most well-known chromosomes for one simple fact: that we say X equals \"girl,\" and Y equals \"boy\" \u2014 that they are responsible for sex. ",
    " And \u2014 and I had to learn this \u2014 but when I'm talking about \"sex\" here, I'm talking about the way biology gives us gonads, which are our ovaries and our testes \u2014 I'm not talking about gender, which is how we identify. And so, as a reporter at the show \u2014 \"Radiolab,\" the audio documentary program I work for \u2014 I was like, what's up with these sex chromosomes? You know, that's kind of my job, I think things are weird, and then I get to call people about them and ask questions, and then hopefully they answer. And in this case, a lot of people answered. ",
    " And in the two years I had of reporting on X and Y, as part of \"Gonads,\" the series on sex and gender I ended up doing for \"Radiolab,\" I found out that these two chromosomes live in a world that is unexpected, a little unsettling; where things that I thought were facts were, like, twisted in ways I hadn't seen before. And the world goes so far beyond the boundaries of sex, I was like, \"Maybe we should all talk about this.\" So, you're you all, we're all going to talk about it. ",
    " And for me, the true story of X and Y starts with their name. So within years of being discovered, these two little chromosomes had acquired more than 10 different names. There was diplosome and heterochromosome and idiochromosome, and most of the names had to do with their structure, their shape, their size. And then there was \"sex chromosome,\" which they had been given because of the fact that we had started seeing that the X would go with the females, and the Y would often go with the males. But scientists were like, \"Do we really want to call them sex chromosomes?\" And science historian Sarah Richardson is the one who told me this story. ",
    " (Audio) Sarah Richardson: For three decades, scientists were like, \"You should not call them the sex chromosomes. The X and Y have many functions, and you wouldn't assume that a single chromosome controls a single trait. Imagine calling one chromosome the 'urogenital chromosome,' or the 'liver chromosome.'\" ",
    " MW: Scientists, if you dig  into the history \u2014 it's really cool, you should \u2014 were hesitant to, like, commit to such a specific name and such a powerfully connotated name. There was a fear that it would actually be really limiting \u2014 maybe to science, maybe to society \u2014 but the fear was in the room. And you can see they ended up getting \"sex chromosome\" \u2014 it's like a pretty juicy title, it popularized genetics, you know? But in the 100-year history since we settled on that name, you can see it starts to get a little complicated. ",
    " So around 1960 \u2014 this is going to be our first stop on the complicated world of the sex chromosomes \u2014 so around 1960, we had discovered that you could be XYY. They discovered an XYY man. And to digress a little here, it turns out that the model of \"X equals girl and Y equals boy\" is really simplistic. You can actually be a whole bunch of different combinations of X and Y, giving you, like, different types of biological sex. You could be two Xs and two Ys together. You could be four Xs, you could be five Xs, you could be XO. And so I thought that was pretty crazy, because I was like, \"Wow, this really upends a model of biological sex I think most of us in this room have been taught.\" So a few years after they realized that you can be XYY, researchers go to a prison in Scotland, and they do genetic analysis of a bunch of the male prisoners. And they find a number of people who are XYY. And according to Sarah: ",
    " (Audio) SR: They just rushed to publish a theory suggesting that this extra Y chromosome could explain criminality in some men. ",
    " MW: Yeah. So the logic goes like this: By this point, we're thinking Y is male. We think male is aggressive, so Y must be aggression. If you've got an extra Y, you must be crazy. And like, we went nuts with this theory. We called it the supermale, they started scanning more prisoners, serial killers, boys. And in all seriousness, there was actually a suggestion that we consider aborting XYY fetuses. ",
    " So in 1980, this theory pretty much toppled, for a number of reasons. One, there had been this really large study that basically showed there was no connection between Y and violence, I think we all saw that coming. And then, there was one other thing. ",
    " (Audio) SR: Going back and looking at those original findings in that high-security psychiatric institution, they had also found a high number of individuals with an extra X chromosome. So these are XXY, as opposed to XYY. ",
    " (Audio) MW: Really? ",
    " (Audio) SR: Yeah.  Now, they never claimed that the individuals with an extra X chromosome were superfemales. They never investigated whether they had higher rates of violence. ",
    " MW: Seems like kind of an oversight. I don't know. But I think it's interesting, because what you see is if you start looking at these chromosomes through the lens of sex, what naturally falls in place behind is we look at them through the lens of gender, and the traits that we associate with gender. So men were violent, and Y explained why they were in prison. The X did not do that, because like, you know, what's X? We don't associate it with violence. And while we don't believe in supermales today \u2014 God, I hope we don't \u2014 we don't believe in supermales today, there is a very similar conversation that's still happening around inherent violence in boys and biology. ",
    " So my next stop on the weird world of X and Y, or things feeling a little topsy-turvy, is 1985. The World University Games were set to happen in Japan, and the Spanish hurdler Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez-Pati\u00f1o was scheduled to run. She was like a hot shot, a rising superstar. And the night before her race, they had her DNA scanned. Now at the time, this was a thing that they were doing, because they were like, \"OK, we don't want men covertly racing as women, so we're going to scan the women and make sure all their Xs line up.\" And so I heard this story from Ruth Padawer who was a New York Times Magazine reporter and she reported on Mar\u00eda. ",
    " (Audio) Ruth Padawer: So they tell her the chromosome test results were abnormal. Although on the outside, she was fully female, she had XY chromosomes and these internal testes. ",
    " MW: They were like, \"We hate to break it to you, Mar\u00eda, but you're actually a dude. You can't race with the ladies.\" ",
    " (Audio) RP: And so she's thrown off the national team, she's expelled from the athletics residence, she's denied her scholarship, a bunch of her friends dump her, fellow athletes abandon her, she loses her medals, her records are revoked. ",
    " MW: So it turns out \u2014 remember when I told you you can be a bunch of different combinations of X and Y \u2014 you can also be XY and be female. You can be XX and male. ",
    " In Mar\u00eda's case, she was something called androgen insensitive. Which means that she did have some sort of internal testes \u2014 they were making testosterone \u2014 but her body couldn't use it. And so if you thought of testosterone as, like, a superpower, she was not benefiting from it. And so eventually, sports authorities, like, let her back in, but her career was done. ",
    " And in this instance you see how, if you assign sex to a specific place in the body, or at least, like, this is what I saw, right? If you assign sex to a specific place in the body, it somehow makes us think that we can go into a body, look at a specific place and tell someone we know something more about them than they know about themselves. And that feels terrifying to me. ",
    " And we don't genetically test female athletes anymore, but you can see very similar conversations happening when we talk about testosterone in sports, you can also see it in suggestions that we take transgender individuals and we genetically analyze them and we tell them who they are. That is real, that is a conversation that has happened recently. ",
    " The last place that I'll share with you where these chromosomes got complicated for me is this one thing that Melissa told me. ",
    " (Audio) Wilson: You can't  survive without an X chromosome. No matter your gonads, no matter your identity, every single human being has to have an X chromosome, because without one, the rest of your body doesn't develop. ",
    " MW: Why do we call this the female chromosome? OK, this is something I had never though about, but literally, every single person in this audience has an X chromosome, I'm not lying. Every single person on the planet has an X chromosome, but no one is going around like, \"This is the every-person chromosome.\" You know? Like, somehow it's over here, the Y is over there, and they must be really different, and I'm just like, it would be so much better if it was the every-person chromosome. And not just because I'm like, love you all and I want you all in, but because of what we're overlooking by the fact that we consider it female. ",
    " Because I'm going to tell you one of the craziest things I found out. Which is, when you think about the X chromosome, of the almost 1,100 genes on the X chromosome, how many do you think have to do with sex and reproduction? Like, get a number in your head. Four percent. That means 96 percent of the rest of that chromosome is doing something that has nothing to do with your gonads. ",
    " And I guess as all of these, sort of, some of them social stories, some of them scientific stories, some of these facts, started to add up, I just thought, like, why are we calling these the sex chromosomes? Or if we are, like, maybe we all like that name, should we just allow ourselves to think about them a little more broadly? ",
    " Because if we do, like, what insights would we gain, as people, as scientists? And we're at this point where we're thinking about, like, how do we want to teach science, what do we want to fund, like, who do we want to be as a society, you know? And I just wondered if it wasn't a moment to rethink the biology of X and Y, and at the very least, to remember, like, the footnotes of history, which is that the dude who came up with the phrase \"sex chromosome,\" actually was like, \"Hey, everyone, just remember, this is just,\" and I quote, \"a form of shorthand.\" We should not take it literally. ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " Every science fiction writer has a story about a time when the future arrived too soon. I have a lot of those stories. Like, OK, for example: years ago, I was writing a story where the government starts using drones to kill people. I thought that this was a really intense, futuristic idea, but by the time the story was published, the government was already using drones to kill people. ",
    " Our world is changing so fast, and there's a kind of accelerating feedback loop where technological change and social change feed on each other. When I was a kid in the 1980s, we knew what the future was going to look like. It was going to be some version of \"Judge Dredd\" or \"Blade Runner.\" It was going to be neon megacities and flying vehicles. But now, nobody knows what the world is going to look like even in just a couple years, and there are so many scary apparitions lurking on the horizon. From climate catastrophe to authoritarianism, everybody is obsessed with apocalypses, even though the world ends all the time, and we keep going. ",
    " Don't be afraid to think about the future, to dream about the future, to write about the future. I've found it really liberating and fun to do that. It's a way of vaccinating yourself against the worst possible case of future shock. It's also a source of empowerment, because you cannot prepare for something that you haven't already visualized. But there's something that you need to know. You don't predict the future; you imagine the future. ",
    " So as a science fiction writer whose stories often take place years or even centuries from now, I've found that people are really hungry for visions of the future that are both colorful and lived in, but I found that research on its own is not enough to get me there. Instead, I use a mixture of active dreaming and awareness of cutting-edge trends in science and technology and also insight into human history. I think a lot about what I know of human nature and the way that people have responded in the past to huge changes and upheavals and transformations. And I pair that with an attention to detail, because the details are where we live. We tell the story of our world through the tools we create and the spaces that we live in. And at this point, it's helpful to know a couple of terms that science fiction writers use all of the time: \"future history\" and \"second-order effects.\" ",
    " Now, future history is basically just what it sounds like. It is a chronology of things that haven't happened yet, like Robert A. Heinlein's famous story cycle, which came with a detailed chart of upcoming events going up into the year 2100. Or, for my most recent novel, I came up with a really complicated time line that goes all the way to the 33rd century and ends with people living on another planet. ",
    " Meanwhile, a second-order effect is basically the kind of thing that happens after the consequences of a new technology or a huge change. There's a saying often attributed to writer and editor Frederik Pohl that \"A good science fiction story should predict not just the invention of the automobile, but also the traffic jam.\" ",
    " And speaking of traffic jams, I spent a lot of time trying to picture the city of the future. What's it like? What's it made of? Who's it for? I try to picture a green city with vertical farms and structures that are partially grown rather than built and walkways instead of streets, because nobody gets around by car anymore \u2014 a city that lives and breathes. And, you know, I kind of start by daydreaming the wildest stuff that I can possibly come up with, and then I go back into research mode, and I try to make it as plausible as I can by looking at a mixture of urban futurism, design porn and technological speculation. And then I go back, and I try to imagine what it would actually be like to be inside that city. So my process kind of begins and ends with imagination, and it's like my imagination is two pieces of bread in a research sandwich. ",
    " So as a storyteller, first and foremost, I try to live in the world through the eyes of my characters and try to see how they navigate their own personal challenges in the context of the space that I've created. What do they smell? What do they touch? What's it like to fall in love inside a smart city? What do you see when you look out your window, and does it depend on how the window's software interacts with your mood? And finally, I ask myself how a future brilliant city would ensure that nobody is homeless and nobody slips through the cracks. ",
    " And here's where future history comes in handy, because cities don't just spring up overnight like weeds. They arise and transform. They bear the scars and ornaments of wars, migrations, economic booms, cultural awakenings. A future city should have monuments, yeah, but it should also have layers of past architecture, repurposed buildings and all of the signs of how we got to this place. ",
    " And then there's second-order effects, like how do things go wrong \u2014 or right \u2014 in a way that nobody ever anticipated? Like, if the walls of your apartment are made out of a kind of fungus that can regrow itself to repair any damage, what if people start eating the walls? ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Speaking of eating: What kind of sewer system does the city of the future have? It's a trick question. There are no sewers. There's something incredibly bizarre about the current system we have in the United States, where your waste gets flushed into a tunnel to be mixed with rainwater and often dumped into the ocean. Not to mention toilet paper. A bunch of techies, led by Bill Gates, are trying to reinvent the toilet right now, and it's possible that the toilet of the future could appear incredibly strange to someone living today. So how does the history of the future, all of that trial and error, lead to a better way to go to the bathroom? There are companies right now who are experimenting with a kind of cleaning wand that can substitute for toilet paper, using compressed air or sanitizing sprays to clean you off. But what if those things looked more like flowers than technology? What if your toilet could analyze your waste and let you know if your microbiome might need a little tune-up? What if today's experiments with turning human waste into fuel leads to a smart battery that could help power your home? ",
    " But back to the city of the future. How do people navigate the space? If there's no streets, how do people even make sense of the geography? I like to think of a place where there are spaces that are partially only in virtual reality that maybe you need special hardware to even discover. Like for one story, I came up with a thing called \"the cloudscape interface,\" which I described as a chrome spider that plugs into your head using temporal nodes. No, that's not a picture of it, but it's a fun picture I took in a bar. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " And I got really carried away imagining the bars, restaurants, caf\u00e9s that you could only find your way inside if you had the correct augmented reality hardware. ",
    " But again, second-order effects: in a world shaped by augmented reality, what kind of new communities will we have, what kind of new crimes that we haven't even thought of yet? OK, like, let's say that you and I are standing next to each other, and you think that we're in a noisy sports bar, and I think we're in a highbrow salon with a string quartet talking about Baudrillard. I can't possibly imagine what might go wrong in that scenario. Like, it's just \u2014 I'm sure it'll be fine. ",
    " And then there's social media. I can imagine some pretty frickin' dystopian scenarios where things like internet quizzes, dating apps, horoscopes, bots, all combine to drag you down deeper and deeper rabbit holes into bad relationships and worse politics. But then I think about the conversations that I've had with people who work on AI, and what I always hear from them is that the smarter AI gets, the better it is at making connections. So maybe the social media of the future will be better. Maybe it'll help us to form healthier, less destructive relationships. Maybe we'll have devices that enable togetherness and serendipity. I really hope so. And, you know, I like to think that if strong AI ever really exists, they'll probably enjoy our weird relationship drama the same way that you and I love to obsess about the \"Real Housewives of Wherever.\" ",
    " And finally, there's medicine. I think a lot about how developments in genetic medicine could improve outcomes for people with cancer or dementia, and maybe one day, your hundredth birthday will be just another milestone on the way to another two or three decades of healthy, active life. Maybe the toilet of the future that I mentioned will improve health outcomes for a lot of people, including people in parts of the world where they don't have these complicated sewer systems that I mentioned. But also, as a transgender person, I like to think: What if we make advances in understanding the endocrine system that improve the options for trans people, the same way that hormones and surgeries expanded the options for the previous generation? ",
    " So finally: basically, I'm here to tell you, people talk about the future as though it's either going to be a technological wonderland or some kind of apocalyptic poop barbecue. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " But the truth is, it's not going to be either of those things. It's going to be in the middle. It's going to be both. It's going to be everything. The one thing we do know is that the future is going to be incredibly weird. Just think about how weird the early 21st century would appear to someone from the early 20th. ",
    " And, you know, there's a kind of logical fallacy that we all have where we expect the future to be an extension of the present. Like, people in the 1980s thought that the Soviet Union would still be around today. But the future is going to be much weirder than we could possibly dream of. But we can try. And I know that there are going to be scary, scary things, but there's also going to be wonders and saving graces. And the first step to finding your way forward is to let your imagination run free. ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " In 1165, copies of a strange letter began  to circulate throughout Western Europe. It spoke of a fantastical realm, containing the Tower of Babel  and the Fountain of Youth\u2014 all ruled over by the letter\u2019s  mysterious author: Prester John. Today, we know that this extraordinary king never existed. But the legend of this mythical kingdom  and its powerful ruler would impact the decisions of European leaders for the next 400 years. Prester John\u2019s myth would propel  the age of exploration, inspire intercontinental diplomacy,  and indirectly begin a civil war. ",
    " When Prester John\u2019s letter appeared,  Europe was embroiled in the Crusades. In this series of religious wars, Europeans campaigned to seize what  they regarded as the Christian Holy Land. The Church vilified any faith  outside of Christianity, including that of the Jewish and Muslim  communities populating the region. Crusaders were eager to find Christian kingdoms to serve as allies in their war. And they were particularly interested in rumors of a powerful Christian king who had defeated an enormous  Muslim army in the Far East. ",
    " In fact, it was a Mongol horde including converted Christian tribes that had routed the army. But news of this victory  traveled unreliably. Merchants and emissaries filled  gaps in the story with epic poems and Biblical fragments. By the time the story reached Europe, the Mongol horde had been replaced with a great Christian army, commanded by a king who shared  the Crusader\u2019s vision of marching on Jerusalem. And when a letter allegedly written by  this so-called \u201cPrester John\u201d appeared, European rulers were thrilled. ",
    " While the letter\u2019s actual author  remains unknown, its stereotypes about the East  and alignment with European goals indicate it was a Western forgery. But despite the letter\u2019s obvious origins  as European propaganda, the appeal of Prester John\u2019s myth  was too great for the Crusaders to ignore. Before long, European mapmakers were guessing  the location of his mythical kingdom. ",
    " In the 13th and 14th centuries,  European missionaries went East, along the newly revived Silk Road. They weren\u2019t searching for  the letter\u2019s author, who would have been over a century old;  but rather, for his descendants. The title of Prester John  was briefly identified with several Central Asian rulers, but it soon became clear that the Mongols were largely non-Christian. And as their Empire began to decline, Europeans began pursuing alternate routes  to the Far East, and new clues to Prester John\u2019s location. ",
    " At the same time these explorers  went south, Ethiopian pilgrims began traveling north. In Rome, these visitors  quickly attracted the interest of European scholars and cartographers. Since Ethiopia had been converted  to Christianity in the 4th century, the stories of their African homeland  fit perfectly into Prester John\u2019s legend. Portuguese explorers scoured Africa  for the kingdom, until a mix of confusion and diplomacy  finally turned myth into reality. ",
    " The Ethiopians graciously received  their European guests, who were eager to do business  with the ruler they believed to be Prester John. Though the Ethiopians were initially  confused by the Portuguese\u2019s unusual name for their Emperor, they were savvy enough to recognize  the diplomatic capital it afforded them. The Ethiopian diplomats played the part  of Prester John\u2019s subjects, and the Portuguese triumphantly announced an alliance with the fabled sovereign\u2014 over 350 years after the European  letter had begun the search. ",
    " But this long-awaited partnership  was quickly tested. A decade later, the Sultanate of Adal, a regional power supported  by the Ottoman Empire, invaded Ethiopia. The Portuguese sent troops that helped  Ethiopians win this conflict. But by this time, it was clear that Ethiopia was not  the powerful ally Europe had hoped. Worse still, the increasingly intolerant  Roman Catholic Church now deemed the Ethiopian sect  of Christianity heretical. Their subsequent attempts to convert  the people they once revered as ideal Christians would eventually spark a civil war, and in the 1630s,  Ethiopia cut ties with Europe. Over the next two centuries, the legend of Prester John  slowly faded into oblivion\u2014 ending the reign of a king who made  history despite having never existed. "

    " Most of you will know about the challenges faced by my beloved continent, Africa. Too many people are poor. Millions of girls don't have access to school. And there aren't enough jobs for the rapidly growing population. Every day, 33,000 new young people join the search for employment. That's 12 million for three million formal jobs. In sub-Saharan Africa, less than one in four young people are likely to get waged or salaried work. The chances of making a secure living are even slimmer for poor and rural young women. They cannot afford an education. And they do not have the same access to wages, loans or land as men. This leaves entire communities trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty, inequality and hopelessness. ",
    " But I'm not here to narrate the doom and gloom, because we also know that a youthful population presents an opportunity to kick-start economic growth and solve global challenges. And in fact, there is a growing movement in Africa, of educated young women, who are stepping up and using the power of their network and a tool we call social interest to uplift communities. ",
    " I'm one of the leaders of the organization behind this movement. An organization that also supported me through school. And I have seen social interest multiply the impact of our work. Social interest is a way to pay back interest on a loan through service, rather than dollars. Sharing time and knowledge through mentoring, academic support, business training to others in need. This means the impact of a loan is felt not by one, but by many. ",
    " Through this system, we've been able to help and send more and more girls to school, support them while they are there, help them start businesses and ultimately, lead in their communities \u2014 all while providing funding for the next generation. Social interest can be used to supercharge any movement where the benefits can be paid forward. ",
    " Let me give you an example. This is Stumai from rural Tanzania. She tragically lost her father when she was just three years old. Leaving a disabled mother to single-handedly raise her and her five siblings. Once Stumai completed primary school, she was about to drop out of school and become one of the 92 percent of girls in sub-Saharan Africa that never finish high school. Instead, she got lucky. She got support from a nonprofit that paid her fees and kept her in school. ",
    " But upon graduating high school, she faced a daunting challenge of what's next. She knew she had to start her own business to survive. And to help her mother, who had tried so hard to keep her in school by selling her only assets, a stack of corrugated iron sheets she had been saving in the hope of building a better home for her children. Stumai also knew she wouldn\u2019t get a loan from a traditional bank, which generally considers young, rural women like her, without land or assets, unbankable. ",
    " Through a special group of lending partners, she secured 350 dollars to start a food shop, selling vegetables, oil, rice, tomatoes, onions and beans. Fellow network members helped to train her on basic business skills, like creating a business plan, working out profits, marketing, keeping business records and the value of savings. And the business took off. She repaid the original loan within eight months, and then borrowed 2,000 dollars to start a motorcycle taxi and courier business. ",
    " Stumai now owns two motorcycles and employs two people. And she has been able to purchase land and build a house, and the business continues to grow from strength to strength. ",
    " Stumai repaid her interest in social interest. She paid social interest by providing mentoring to girls in a local high school. She volunteered weekly as a learner guide, delivering a life skills and well-being curriculum that helps children gain the confidence to ask questions, care for and support each other, learn about health and nutrition, set goals and learn how to achieve them. Stumai says her greatest reward is witnessing the girls she mentors start to believe in themselves and succeeding. ",
    " These days, Stumai also trains other learner guides. That's multiplying the number of girls making it through school and into secure livelihoods like she did. Through her business profits, she has been able to support her siblings, three nieces and nephews and other children in her community to go to school. She also regularly supports other network members. For example, a young woman studying for a diploma in community development. In the past two years, Stumai helped her with money for bus fare, for sanitary pads, for soap and encouraged her to keep going. Stumai spends 370 dollars a year supporting the education of others. That's 17 percent of her gross earnings from her motorcycle business. This is the power of social interest. ",
    " Stumai's example shows that if you help one girl, not only to go to school, but graduate and start a business, she can in turn make a giant difference in the lives of others and her community. Had Stumai paid back interest on her loan in dollars, her success might have been felt by her and her immediate family, but because she paid interest as social interest, the impact was felt by her mentees, her nieces, nephews, her employees and so many others around her. Stumai is just one example of many. ",
    " Today, we have 7,000 learner guides like Stumai, working across Malawi, Tanzania, Ghana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. And collectively, they've helped children do better in school. The girls we work with are nearly three times less likely to drop out of school, because learner guides make home visits when girls fail to attend school to help them back on track. They also work with communities and district governments to address the challenges children face, including preventing or annulling child marriages, connecting children facing hunger or hardship at home with local support, or running study groups so that children who might be lagging behind in their studies can get supporters and catch up. They act as trusted sisters, friends and guardians. ",
    " So far, nearly 6,300 network members have borrowed close to three million dollars, with a repayment rate of those loans at consistently above 95 percent. And our 140,000 members, they have invested their own resources to support and send over 937,000 children to primary and secondary school. Every young woman we work with supports, on average, another three children outside of her immediate family to go to school. All without additional money from us. ",
    " We are building a powerful force. Gaining ever greater momentum as we open the door for more and more girls to go to school, succeed, lead and in turn, support thousands more. This system, supporting those once excluded to transform their lives and then step up for others, can work for more than girls' education. Of course, you need to get your money back if you lend it. But instead of demanding interest in dollars, can you consider using social interest instead? ",
    " For example, could young people pass on the skills they learned in training colleges? Like Michelle, who teaches brickmaking in rural Zimbabwe. Or Louisa, who is training others on climate-smart agriculture in Malawi. Or Fatima in Ghana, who is training women to help deliver babies where expectant mothers might not be able to make it to the local hospital on time. ",
    " When I was growing up, an elder in my village in rural Zimbabwe once described the challenges I faced in going to school. She said, \"Those who harvest many pumpkins often do not have the clay pots to cook them in.\" ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " What she meant was that, although I got the best possible results in my exams when I finished elementary school, my talent was of no value if my family could not afford to pay for me to continue my education. Well, with this system, we are not just providing pots, or making a single meal out of the pumpkins. After all, there are hundreds of seeds in a single pumpkin. We are saving the seeds, planting them and nurturing every one of them. And the result? A virtual cycle of prosperity, equality and hope, led by young women. Because together, we are shaking up the world. Pamoja tunaweza \u2014 that's Swahili for my network motto: \"Together we can!\" ",
    " Thank you. ",
    " (Applause) "

    " So what do people usually say when you're about to give a public talk? It's to imagine that your audience is naked. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Well, I'm doing a different trick tonight, and I'm going to imagine all of us without farmers, and well, it's not so much different. ",
    " [Without farmers you'd be hungry, naked and sober] ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " And our farmers do so much more for us than simply feed and clothe and provide us excellent things to drink. Our farmers are an important part of all of our communities, particularly our rural communities. And more than that, they're a strong driver of resilient economics. Think about it this way: When a brewer buys hops from me, grown here in Minnesota, 90 percent of that dollar stays in our state, compared to just 10 percent when they buy it from somewhere else. What that means is a lot. That 90 percent means local jobs. It means tax revenue for better schools and roads. It means support for the co-ops, the mechanics, all the support staff that are needed for a farm to thrive. And they're our best stewards of the land. ",
    " This quote, I think, exemplifies what our family farmers do for us in stewarding our shared natural resources. \"That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology, but that land is to be loved and respected as an extension of ethics.\" ",
    " Now, they sure do a lot of good stuff for us. And our family farmers are great, we'd all agree. However, the trends in agriculture today are dire. The average age of a farmer in America, according to the latest agricultural census \u2014 58.3. Of all the farmers, 33 percent are 65 plus. That's a little caricature of my grandpa. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " He's still farming, and he's much older than 65. But to put that in perspective, another important public service job, teaching, average age of teachers is 42. Our farmers are pretty old in this country. And unfortunately, when they retire, if they retire, we're not really replacing them. Of all the farmers that we added in this country between 2008 and 2012, across the entire United States \u2014 see if you can catch this difference \u2014 we added 2,000 under the age of 30. I'm one of those. I'll be around to autograph some photos later, if you'd like. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " But, you know, our farmers are getting older and we're not replacing them \u2014 what's going on here? What are we going to do? And I think there's a reason folks aren't coming into it, and that's prices. ",
    " We're going to go through a couple of slides like this. Milk: This is the average retail price of a gallon of milk in the United States. Four dollars forty-nine cents. How much do you think the farmer gets? Dollar thirty-two. We'll try again with bread. Average retail price of bread in America, three forty-nine. Farmer gets ... Twelve cents. ",
    " Audience: Oh! ",
    " And so how are we supposed to have strong local farms in this scenario? What are we supposed to do if there aren't any local farmers left? And this isn't just a farmer problem, it's not just something for the few of us farmers to sort out. This is an all-of-us problem. This is rural and it's urban and it's statewide and it's nationwide. So what do we do about it? I'll tell you that. ",
    " But first, a story. The green movement, we're all kind of familiar, started in the '60s, planting trees. And now we've come such a long way. Green is part of our day-to-day lives. It's part of the day-to-day lives of Fortune 500 businesses. It's the subject of international treaties, the subject of presidential debates. You and I, we switch our light bulbs, we use reusable bags. We participate in the green movement each and every day. Yet ... and this is how we get to the idea \u2014 the food movement, relatively younger, but also somewhat familiar, I imagine. ",
    " You go to the grocery store, you see a sign that says \"Buy local,\" you go to the farmers market, you go to the co-op, you read books by prominent authors. The food movement to date could be summarized as voting with your fork. The idea is: you pull a dollar out of your wallet \u2014 how you spend that dollar affects the food system. It supports farmers close to home. And that's all well and good, but where are we going? How do we get to our renewable-energy moment like the green movement did? And this, I think, is what we need to do. ",
    " Just voting with our fork is not solving the issues that our farmers are facing. And so we need to do more than that. I believe we must move on from just voting with our fork to voting with our vote. We need to take our dollars and continue to spend them locally. We also need to show up at the ballot box for our farmers. This is bigger than just buying local strawberries once a year at a pick-your-own. This is a year-round effort that we must make together to make the change we need. Changes like fair pricing for farmers. That's quotas, supply management, guaranteed prices. Changes like fair and open trade. That means ending trade wars. And yeah, of course it means voting. Now we all knew that one already, though. For example, it's working. ",
    " Hey, who's that? ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Just this year in Minnesota, we've passed a historic, first-in-the-country tax credit. The Beginning Farmer Tax Credit. It incentivizes our transition of land from the existing generation to the next generation. That was done by a handful of us young farmers \u2014 we certainly don't have money, you saw that earlier. We don't have political experience. But we showed up, and we made our voices heard. And thanks to the support of farmers and non-farmers alike, we got something incredible done here in this state. If we can do it, anybody can do it. ",
    " Now, that was all light and fuzzy and feels pretty happy. Skeptics in the audience, you're here. That would be me, if I were here. Skeptics are thinking, \"Wow, what do we need to change about our food system?\" Farmers are great. We have unlimited food, and it's real cheap, too, isn't that great? Well, unfortunately, in the '80s and the '90s in this country, we went down a path of policy that could be described as \"get big or get out.\" And what \"get big or get out\" means is you maximize production while minimizing costs. On its face value, that sounds pretty simple. However, that shift turned our farmers from a venerated class and a valued class in our society into a cost to be minimized. That shift made it so that my great-grandfather, who supported the family with six cows, that same dairy, trying to support their family, has to be 600 cows today. Six-thousand-cow dairies are not unheard of. What happens when there's this one dairy farm in an entire county, where there used to be hundreds? ",
    " The same could be said with corn or beans or field crops. What happens when it takes 10,000 acres for one person to support themselves? When it used to only take 40. We know what happens, we read about it in the news. Broadly determined, rural decline, but schools close, schools consolidate, post offices close, grocery stores close. People leave, the community suffers and goes away. ",
    " I believe all of us in this audience with ties to rural Minnesota know this story well. This is not a problem that we can solve with farmers markets and good intentions. We have to do more for our farmers. Policy got us into this mess, and policy can get us out. American farmers are only getting older, fewer and poorer, yet they are crucial to our state. They're the vibrancy in our rural communities. They're the drivers of economic growth and stability, and they are our best protectors of our shared resources of land, water and air. So we have to do better for them. ",
    " So join me, would you? Let's fight for our farmers. You can see it, we're already doing it in Minnesota, having great success. And together, we can do even more. And we must. So we were voting with our fork before, and we want to keep doing that. But if I could have one idea for you to go home with today, it's vote with your vote. And so to that end, on the count of three, I'd like all of us to say it together. Are you ready? OK, one, two, three. ",
    " Audience: Vote with your vote. ",
    " Very nice, thank you. I think you got it. ",
    " (Applause) "

    " In 1958, Rachel Carson received a letter describing songbirds suddenly dropping  from tree branches. The writer blamed their deaths  on a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed  on a nearby marsh. ",
    " The letter was the push  Carson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists  and conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide  posed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries  through government contacts from her years working  in the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: \u201cwhat has already silenced  the voices of spring?\u201d ",
    " In 1962, Carson published her findings  in \"Silent Spring.\" Her book documented  the misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature  and human health. \"Silent Spring\" immediately drew both  applause and impassioned dissent\u2014 along with vicious personal attacks  on the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist  and writer ignite such controversy? ",
    " Carson began her career  as a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology  at John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school  before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father  and sister. Carson found part time work  with the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program  on marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could  hold the general public\u2019s attention impressed her superiors,  and in 1936, she became the second woman  to be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published  the first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations on underwater worlds. These explorations resonated  with a wide audience. ",
    " In \"Silent Spring,\"  Carson turned her attention to the ways human actions  threaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during  World War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers  from insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed  in wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants  in the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately, but did little to eliminate the ants. ",
    " In spite of this and other mishaps,  the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies  extolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public  awareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how  the overuse of chemicals led to the evolution  of resistant species\u2014 which, in turn, encouraged the development of deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time  it would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues  of animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT  might alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences  for future generations. ",
    " The response to \"Silent Spring\"  was explosive. For many people the book  was a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson  hadn\u2019t mentioned DDT\u2019s role controlling the threat insects  posed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture  Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know \u201cwhy a spinster with no children  was so concerned about genetics?\u201d and dismissed Carson  as \u201cprobably a Communist.\u201d A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer  alluded to Carson and her supporters as \u201csinister influences\u201d  aiming to paint businesses as \u201cimmoral.\u201d ",
    " In reality, Carson had focused  on the dangers of chemicals because they weren\u2019t widely understood,  while the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief  that humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people  to cultivate \u201cmaturity and mastery, not of nature,  but of ourselves.\u201d ",
    " Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after  the publication of \"Silent Spring.\" Her work galvanized a generation  of environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure  from environmentalists, Congress passed  the National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created  the Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued  a partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel Carson  continued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact  of her writing. "

    " I'm here, because I've spent far too many nights lying awake, worrying and wondering who wins in the end. Is it humans or is it robots? ",
    " You see, as a technology strategist, my job involves behavior change: understanding why and how people adopt new technologies. And that means I'm really frustrated that I know I won't live to see how this all ends up. And in fact, if the youngest person watching this is 14 and the oldest, a robust 99, then together, our collective consciousnesses span just 185 years. That is a myopic pinprick of time when you think of the evolution and the story of life on this planet. Turns out we're all in the cheap seats and none of us will live to see how it all pans out. ",
    " So at my company, we wanted a way around this. We wanted to see if there was a way to cantilever out, beyond our fixed temporal vantage point, to get a sense of how it all shakes up. And to do this, we conducted a study amongst 1,200 Americans representative of the US census, in which we asked a battery of attitudinal questions around robotics and AI and also captured behavioral ones around technology adoption. ",
    " We had a big study so that we could analyze differences in gender and generations, between religious and political beliefs, even job function and personality trait. It is a fascinating, time-bound time capsule of our human frailty in this predawn of the robotic era. And I have five minutes to tell you about it. ",
    " The first thing you should know is that we brainstormed a list of scenarios of current and potential AI robotics. They ran the spectrum from the mundane, so, a robot house cleaner, anyone? Through to the mischievous, the idea of a robot pet sitter, or maybe a robot lawyer, or maybe a sex partner. Through to the downright macabre, the idea of being a cyborg, blending human and robot, or uploading your brain so it could live on after your death. And we plotted people's comfort levels with these various scenarios. There were actually 31 in the study, but for ease, I'm going to show you just a few of them here. ",
    " The first thing you'll notice, of course, is the sea of red. America is very uncomfortable with this stuff. That's why we call it the discomfort index, not the comfort index. There were only two things the majority of America is OK with. And that's the idea of a robot AI house cleaner and a robot AI package deliverer, so Dyson and Amazon, you guys should talk. There's an opportunity there. ",
    " It seems we're ready to off-load our chores to our robot friends. We're kind of definitely on the fence when it comes to services, so robot AI lawyer or a financial adviser, maybe. But we're firmly closed to the idea of robot care, whether it be a nurse, a doctor, child care. So from this, you'd go, \"It's OK, Lucy, you know what? Go back to sleep, stop worrying, the humans win in the end.\" But actually not so fast. ",
    " If you look at my data very closely, you can see we're more vulnerable than we think. AI has a branding problem. So of those folks who said that they would absolutely reject the idea of a personal assistant, 45 percent of them had, in fact, one in their pockets, in terms of a device with Alexa, Google or Siri. One in five of those who were against the idea of AI matchmaking had of course, you guessed it, done online dating. And 80 percent of those of us who refuse the idea of boarding an autonomous plane with a pilot backup had in fact, just like me to get here to Vancouver, flown commercial. ",
    " Lest you think everybody was scared, though, here are the marvelous folk in the middle. These are the neutrals. These are people for whom you say, \"OK, robot friend,\" and they're like, \"Hm, robot friend. Maybe.\" Or, \"AI pet,\" and they go, \"Never say never.\" And as any decent political operative knows, flipping the ambivalent middle can change the game. ",
    " Another reason I know we're vulnerable is men \u2014 I'm sorry, but men, you are twice as likely than women to believe that getting into an autonomous car is a good idea, that uploading your brain for posterity is fun, and two and a half times more likely to believe that becoming a cyborg is cool, and for this, I blame Hollywood. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " And this is where I want you to look around the theater and know that one in four men are OK with the idea of sex with a robot. That goes up to 44 percent of millennial men compared to just one in 10 women, which I think puts a whole new twist on the complaint of mechanical sex. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Even more astounding than that though, to be honest, is this behavioral difference. So here we have people who have a device with a voice assistant in it, so a smart speaker, a home hub or a smart phone, versus those who don't. And you can see from this graph that the Trojan horse is already in our living room. And as these devices proliferate and our collective defenses soften, we all see how it can end. In fact, this may be as good a time as any to admit I did take my Alexa Dot on vacation with me. ",
    " Final finding I have time for is generational. So look at the difference just three generations make. This is the leap from silent to boomer to millennial. And what's more fascinating than this is if you extrapolate this out, the same rate of change, just the same pace, not the accelerated one I actually believe will be the case, the same pace, then it is eight generations away when we hear every single American thinking the majority of these things here are normal. So the year 2222 is an astounding place where everything here is mainstream. ",
    " And lest you needed any more convincing, here is the generation's \"excitement level with AI.\" So not surprisingly, the youngest of us are more excited. But, and possibly the most paradoxical finding of my career, when I asked these people my 3am question, \"Who wins in the end?\" Guess what. The more excited you are about AI and robotics, the more likely you are to say it's the robots. And I don't think we need a neural net running pattern-recognition software to see where this is all headed. We are the proverbial frogs in boiling water. So if the robots at TED2222 are watching this for posterity, could you send a cyborg, dig me up and tell me if I was right? ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " I want to lead here by talking a little bit about my credentials to bring this up with you, because, quite honestly, you really, really should not listen to any old person with an opinion about COVID-19. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " So I've been working in global health for about 20 years, and my specific technical specialty is in health systems and what happens when health systems experience severe shocks. I've also worked in global health journalism; I've written about global health and biosecurity for newspapers and web outlets, and I published a book a few years back about the major global health threats facing us as a planet. I have supported and led epidemiology efforts that range from evaluating Ebola treatment centers to looking at transmission of tuberculosis in health facilities and doing avian influenza preparedness. I have a master's degree in International Health. I'm not a physician. I'm not a nurse. My specialty isn't patient care or taking care of individual people. My specialty is looking at populations and health systems, what happens when diseases move on the large level. If we're ranking sources of global health expertise on a scale of one to 10, one is some random person ranting on Facebook and 10 is the World Health Organization, I'd say you can probably put me at like a seven or an eight. So keep that in mind as I talk to you. ",
    " I'll start with the basics here, because I think that's gotten lost in some of the media noise around COVID-19. So, COVID-19 is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a specific subset of virus, and they have some unique characteristics as viruses. They use RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material, and they're covered in spikes on the surface of the virus. They use those spikes to invade cells. Those spikes are the corona in coronavirus. COVID-19 is known as a novel coronavirus because, until December, we'd only heard of six coronaviruses. COVID-19 is the seventh. It's new to us. It just had its gene sequencing, it just got its name. That's why it's novel. ",
    " If you remember SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, those were coronaviruses. And they're both called respiratory syndromes, because that's what coronaviruses do \u2014 they go for your lungs. They don't make you puke, they don't make you bleed from the eyeballs, they don't make you hemorrhage. They head for your lungs. ",
    " COVID-19 is no different. It causes a range of respiratory symptoms that go from stuff like a dry cough and a fever all the way out to fatal viral pneumonia. And that range of symptoms is one of the reasons it's actually been so hard to track this outbreak. Plenty of people get COVID-19 but so gently, their symptoms are so mild, they don't even go to a health care provider. They don't register in the system. Children, in particular, have it very easy with COVID-19, which is something we should all be grateful for. ",
    " Coronaviruses are zoonotic, which means that they transmit from animals to people. Some coronaviruses, like COVID-19, also transmit person to person. The person-to-person ones travel faster and travel farther, just like COVID-19. Zoonotic illnesses are really hard to get rid of, because they have an animal reservoir. One example is avian influenza, where we can abolish it in farmed animals, in turkeys, in ducks, but it keeps coming back every year because it's brought to us by wild birds. You don't hear a lot about it because avian influenza doesn't transmit person-to-person, but we have outbreaks in poultry farms every year all over the world. COVID-19 most likely skipped from animals into people at a wild animal market in Wuhan, China. ",
    " Now for the less basic parts. This is not the last major outbreak we're ever going to see. There's going to be more outbreaks, and there's going to be more epidemics. That's not a maybe. That's a given. And it's a result of the way that we, as human beings, are interacting with our planet. Human choices are driving us into a position where we're going to see more outbreaks. Part of that is about climate change and the way a warming climate makes the world more hospitable to viruses and bacteria. But it's also about the way we're pushing into the last wild spaces on our planet. ",
    " When we burn and plow the Amazon rain forest so that we can have cheap land for ranching, when the last of the African bush gets converted to farms, when wild animals in China are hunted to extinction, human beings come into contact with wildlife populations that they've never come into contact with before, and those populations have new kinds of diseases: bacteria, viruses, stuff we're not ready for. Bats, in particular, have a knack for hosting illnesses that can infect people, but they're not the only animals that do it. So as long as we keep making our remote places less remote, the outbreaks are going to keep coming. ",
    " We can't stop the outbreaks with quarantine or travel restrictions. That's everybody's first impulse: \"Let's stop the people from moving. Let's stop this outbreak from happening.\" But the fact is, it's really hard to get a good quarantine in place. It's really hard to set up travel restrictions. Even the countries that have made serious investments in public health, like the US and South Korea, can't get that kind of restriction in place fast enough to actually stop an outbreak instantly. There's logistical reasons for that, and there's medical reasons. If you look at COVID-19 right now, it seems like it could have a period where you're infected and show no symptoms that's as long as 24 days. So people are walking around with this virus showing no signs. They're not going to get quarantined. Nobody knows they need quarantining. ",
    " There's also some real costs to quarantine and to travel restrictions. Humans are social animals, and they resist when you try to hold them into place and when you try to separate them. We saw in the Ebola outbreak that as soon as you put a quarantine in place, people start trying to evade it. Individual patients, if they know there's a strict quarantine protocol, may not go for health care, because they're afraid of the medical system or they can't afford care and they don't want to be separated from their family and friends. Politicians, government officials, when they know that they're going to get quarantined if they talk about outbreaks and cases, may conceal real information for fear of triggering a quarantine protocol. And, of course, these kinds of evasions and dishonesty are exactly what makes it so difficult to track a disease outbreak. We can get better at quarantines and travel restrictions, and we should, but they're not our only option, and they're not our best option for dealing with these situations. ",
    " The real way for the long haul to make outbreaks less serious is to build the global health system to support core health care functions in every country in the world so that all countries, even poor ones, are able to rapidly identify and treat new infectious diseases as they emerge. China's taken a lot of criticism for its response to COVID-19. But the fact is, what if COVID-19 had emerged in Chad, which has three and a half doctors for every hundred thousand people? What if it had emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which just released its last Ebola patient from treatment? The truth is, countries like this don't have the resources to respond to an infectious disease \u2014 not to treat people and not to report on it fast enough to help the rest of the world. ",
    " I led an evaluation of Ebola treatment centers in Sierra Leone, and the fact is that local doctors in Sierra Leone identified the Ebola crisis very quickly, first as a dangerous, contagious hemorrhagic virus and then as Ebola itself. But, having identified it, they didn't have the resources to respond. They didn't have enough doctors, they didn't have enough hospital beds and they didn't have enough information about how to treat Ebola or how to implement infection control. Eleven doctors died in Sierra Leone of Ebola. The country only had 120 when the crisis started. By way of contrast, Dallas Baylor Medical Center has more than a thousand physicians on staff. ",
    " These are the kinds of inequities that kill people. First, they kill the poor people when the outbreaks start, and then they kill people all over the world when the outbreaks spread. If we really want to slow down these outbreaks and minimize their impact, we need to make sure that every country in the world has the capacity to identify new diseases, treat them and report about them so they can share information. ",
    " COVID-19 is going to be a huge burden on health systems. COVID-19 has also revealed some real weaknesses in our global health supply chains. Just-in-time-ordering, lean systems are great when things are going well, but in a time of crisis, what it means is we don't have any reserves. If a hospital \u2014 or a country \u2014 runs out of face masks or personal protective equipment, there's no big warehouse full of boxes that we can go to to get more. You have to order more from the supplier, you have to wait for them to produce it and you have to wait for them to ship it, generally from China. That's a time lag at a time when it's most important to move quickly. ",
    " If we'd been perfectly prepared for COVID-19, China would have identified the outbreak faster. They would have been ready to provide care to infected people without having to build new buildings. They would have shared honest information with citizens so that we didn't see these crazy rumors spreading on social media in China. And they would have shared information with global health authorities so that they could start reporting to national health systems and getting ready for when the virus spread. National health systems would then have been able to stockpile the protective equipment they needed and train health care providers on treatment and infection control. We'd have science-based protocols for what to do when things happen, like cruise ships have infected patients. And we'd have real information going out to people everywhere, so we wouldn't see embarrassing, shameful incidents of xenophobia, like Asian-looking people getting attacked on the street in Philadelphia. But even with all of that in place, we would still have outbreaks. The choices we're making about how we occupy this planet make that inevitable. ",
    " As far as we have an expert consensus on COVID-19, it's this: here in the US, and globally, it's going to get worse before it gets better. We're seeing cases of human transmission that aren't from returning travel, that are just happening in the community, and we're seeing people infected with COVID-19 when we don't even know where the infection came from. Those are signs of an outbreak that's getting worse, not an outbreak that's under control. ",
    " It's depressing, but it's not surprising. Global health experts, when they talk about the scenario of new viruses, this is one of the scenarios that they look at. We all hoped we'd get off easy, but when experts talk about viral planning, this is the kind of situation and the way they expect the virus to move. ",
    " I want to close here with some personal advice. Wash your hands. Wash your hands a lot. I know you already wash your hands a lot because you're not disgusting, but wash your hands even more. Set up cues and routines in your life to get you to wash your hands. Wash your hands every time you enter and leave a building. Wash your hands when you go into a meeting and when you come out of a meeting. Get rituals that are based around handwashing. ",
    " Sanitize your phone. You touch that phone with your dirty, unwashed hands all the time. I know you take it into the bathroom with you. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " So sanitize your phone and consider not using it as often in public. Maybe TikTok and Instagram can be home things only. ",
    " Don't touch your face. Don't rub your eyes. Don't bite your fingernails. Don't wipe your nose on the back of your hand. I mean, don't do that anyway because, gross. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Don't wear a face mask. Face masks are for sick people and health care providers. If you're sick, your face mask holds in all your coughing and sneezing and protects the people around you. And if you're a health care provider, your face mask is one tool in a set of tools called personal protective equipment that you're trained to use so that you can give patient care and not get sick yourself. If you're a regular healthy person wearing a face mask, it's just making your face sweaty. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Leave the face masks in stores for the doctors and the nurses and the sick people. ",
    " If you think you have symptoms of COVID-19, stay home, call your doctor for advice. If you're diagnosed with COVID-19, remember it's generally very mild. And if you're a smoker, right now is the best possible time to quit smoking. I mean, if you're a smoker, right now is always the best possible time to quit smoking, but if you're a smoker and you're worried about COVID-19, I guarantee that quitting is absolutely the best thing you can do to protect yourself from the worst impacts of COVID-19. ",
    " COVID-19 is scary stuff, at a time when pretty much all of our news feels like scary stuff. And there's a lot of bad but appealing options for dealing with it: panic, xenophobia, agoraphobia, authoritarianism, oversimplified lies that make us think that hate and fury and loneliness are the solution to outbreaks. But they're not. They just make us less prepared. ",
    " There's also a boring but useful set of options that we can use in response to outbreaks, things like improving health care here and everywhere; investing in health infrastructure and disease surveillance so that we know when the new diseases come; building health systems all over the world; looking at strengthening our supply chains so they're ready for emergencies; and better education, so we're capable of talking about disease outbreaks and the mathematics of risk without just blind panic. ",
    " We need to be guided by equity here, because in this situation, like so many, equity is actually in our own self-interest. ",
    " So thank you so much for listening to me today, and can I be the first one to tell you: wash your hands when you leave the theater. ",
    " (Applause) "

    " [How can we control the coronavirus pandemic?] ",
    " [From infectious disease expert Adam Kucharski] ",
    " [Question 1: What does containment mean when it comes to outbreaks?] ",
    " Containment is this idea that you can focus your effort on control very much on the cases and their contacts. So you're not causing disruption to the wider population, you have a case that comes in, you isolate them, you work out who they've come into contact with, who's potentially these opportunities for exposure and then you can follow up those people, maybe quarantine them, to make sure that no further transmission happens. So it's a very focused, targeted method, and for SARS, it worked remarkably well. But I think for this infection, because some cases are going to be missed, or undetected, you've really got to be capturing a large chunk of people at risk. If a few slip through the net, potentially, you're going to get an outbreak. ",
    " [Question 2: If containment isn't enough, what comes next?] ",
    " In that respect, it would be about massive changes in our social interactions. And so that would require, of the opportunities that could spread the virus so these kind of close contacts, everybody in the population, on average, will be needing to reduce those interactions potentially by two-thirds to bring it under control. That might be through working from home, from changing lifestyle and kind of where you go in crowded places and dinners. And of course, these measures, things like school closures, and other things that just attempt to reduce the social mixing of a population. ",
    " [Question 3: What are the risks that we need people to think about?] ",
    " It's not just whose hand you shake, it's whose hand that person goes on to shake. And I think we need to think about these second-degree steps, that you might think you have low risk and you're in a younger group, but you're often going to be a very short step away from someone who is going to get hit very hard by this. And I think we really need to be socially minded and think this could be quite dramatic in terms of change of behavior, but it needs to be to reduce the impact that we're potentially facing. ",
    " [Question 4: How far apart should people stay from each other?] ",
    " I think it's hard to pin down exactly, but I think one thing to bear in mind is that there's not so much evidence that this is a kind of aerosol and it goes really far \u2014 it's reasonably short distances. I don't think it's the case that you're sitting a few meters away from someone and the virus is somehow going to get across. It's in closer interactions, and it's why we're seeing so many transmission events occur in things like meals and really tight-knit groups. Because if you imagine that's where you can get a virus out and onto surfaces and onto hands and onto faces, and it's really situations like that we've got to think more about. ",
    " [Question 5: What kind of protective measures should countries put in place?] ",
    " I think that's what people are trying to piece together, first in terms of what works. It's only really in the last sort of few weeks we've got a sense that this thing can be controllable with this extent of interventions, but of course, not all countries can do what China have done, some of these measures incur a huge social, economic, psychological burden on populations. And of course, there's the time limit. In China, they've had them in for six weeks, it's tough to maintain that, so we need to think of these tradeoffs of all the things we can ask people to do, what's going to have the most impact on actually reducing the burden.

    " Antibiotics: behind the scenes,  they enable much of modern medicine. We use them to cure infectious diseases, but also to safely facilitate everything  from surgery to chemotherapy to organ transplants. Without antibiotics, even routine medical procedures  can lead to life-threatening infections. And we\u2019re at risk of losing them. ",
    " Antibiotics are chemicals  that prevent the growth of bacteria. Unfortunately, some bacteria  have become resistant to all currently available antibiotics. At the same time,  we\u2019ve stopped discovering new ones. Still, there\u2019s hope that we can get ahead  of the problem. ",
    " But first, how did we  get into this situation? The first widely used antibiotic  was penicillin, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. In his 1945 Nobel Prize  acceptance speech, Fleming warned that bacterial resistance  had the potential to ruin the miracle of antibiotics. He was right: in the 1940s and 50s, resistant bacteria  already began to appear. ",
    " From then until the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies  countered the problem of resistance by discovering many new antibiotics. At first this was a highly successful\u2014  and highly profitable\u2014 enterprise. ",
    " Over time, a couple things changed. Newly discovered antibiotics  were often only effective for a narrow spectrum of infections, whereas the first ones  had been broadly applicable. This isn\u2019t a problem in itself, but it does mean that fewer doses  of these drugs could be sold\u2014 making them less profitable. In the early days,  antibiotics were heavily overprescribed, including for viral infections  they had no effect on. Scrutiny around prescriptions increased,  which is good, but also lowered sales. At the same time,  companies began to develop more drugs that are taken over a patient\u2019s lifetime, like blood pressure  and cholesterol medications, and later anti-depressants  and anti-anxiety medications. Because they are taken indefinitely,  these drugs more profitable. ",
    " By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes  of antibiotics were discovered. But bacteria continued to acquire  resistance and pass it along by sharing genetic information  between individual bacteria and even across species. Now bacteria that are resistant  to many antibiotics are common, and increasingly some strains  are resistant to all our current drugs. ",
    " So, what can we do about this? We need to control the use  of existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new  and existing drugs, and find new ways to fight  bacterial infections. The largest consumer  of antibiotics is agriculture, which uses antibiotics not only  to treat infections but to promote the growth of food animals. Using large volumes of antibiotics increases the bacteria\u2019s exposure  to the antibiotics and therefore their opportunity  to develop resistance. Many bacteria that are common in animals,  like salmonella, can also infect humans, and drug-resistant versions can pass  to us through the food chain and spread through international trade  and travel networks. ",
    " In terms of finding new antibiotics, nature offers the most promising  new compounds. Organisms like other microbes and fungi  have evolved over millions of years to live in competitive environments\u2014 meaning they often contain  antibiotic compounds to give them a survival advantage  over certain bacteria. ",
    " We can also package antibiotics  with molecules that inhibit resistance. One way bacteria develop resistance  is through proteins of their own that degrade the drug. By packaging the antibiotic with molecules that block the degraders, the antibiotic can do its job. ",
    " Phages, viruses that attack bacteria  but don\u2019t affect humans, are one promising new avenue  to combat bacterial infections. Developing vaccines for common infections, meanwhile, can help prevent disease  in the first place. ",
    " The biggest challenge to all  these approaches is funding, which is woefully inadequate  across the globe. Antibiotics are so unprofitable  that many large pharmaceutical companies have stopped trying to develop them. Meanwhile, smaller companies  that successfully bring new antibiotics to market often still go bankrupt,  like the American start up Achaogen. New therapeutic techniques  like phages and vaccines face the same fundamental problem  as traditional antibiotics: if they\u2019re working well,  they\u2019re used just once, which makes it difficult to make money. And to successfully counteract resistance  in the long term, we\u2019ll need to use  new antibiotics sparingly\u2014 lowering the profits  for their creators even further. ",
    " One possible solution is to shift profits  away from the volume of antibiotics sold. For example, the United Kingdom  is testing a model where healthcare providers  purchase antibiotic subscriptions. While governments are looking for ways  to incentivize antibiotic development, these programs are still  in the early stages. Countries around the world  will need to do much more\u2014 but with enough investment  in antibiotic development and controlled use of our current drugs, we can still get ahead of resistance. "

    " Menstruation. A simple word describing a natural biological process, weighed down by centuries of stigma, has been transformed into something most of us can only speak about in whispers. But why? As I speak to you right now, more than 800 million women around the world are having a period. None of us would exist without it, and yet it remains an \"embarrassing\" subject to broach. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. ",
    " It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings pretending to be absolutely normal, while internally crying out from intense period cramps. It's exhausting to be dismissively told that you\u2019re PMSing or suffering from \"that time of the month,\" and it's exhausting to continuously fight back against age-old traditions that ask you not to pray, visit temples, cook, touch pickle and the list goes on and on, while you're just trying to bleed and be left in peace. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " But you know what the worst part is? The worst part is that the things that seem tiring to us are merely the tip of the iceberg, because we in this room are privileged enough to be able to afford sanitary napkins every month, to be able to visit a gynecologist in case of any problem, to be able to tell what's normal and abnormal with our monthly cycle. We have access to water, sanitation and toilets that help us maintain our privacy and hygiene. ",
    " But what about those who don't? What about 335 million girls around the world who go to school without even having access to water and soap to wash their hands? What about 15-year-old schoolgirls in Kenya who have to sell their bodies to be able to buy sanitary napkins? What about two-thirds of rural high school girls in India who don't even understand what their bodies are going through at menarche? And right now, we are all gathered here in the USA. So what about 64 percent of women in St. Louis, Missouri, who weren't able to afford menstrual hygiene supplies in the previous year? What about the struggles of homeless, transgender, intersex and displaced people who menstruate? What about them? ",
    " The scale of the problem, stemming in part from the deep-rooted stigma attached to menstruation, is unimaginable. And the desire to voice this frustration led me, along with three other teammates, to initiate a campaign that calls for change, questions the taboos surrounding menstruation and spreads period positivity. The name of our campaign, \"Pravahkriti,\" was born from the message that we want to convey to the world. \"Pravah\" means \"flow,\" and \"kriti\" means \"a beautiful creation.\" Because how could the monthly cycle that ultimately gives rise to all creation be anything less than beautiful? ",
    " Now, as a social issue, menstruation has several facets to it that overlap, reinforce and worsen the situation. So we based our campaign on four fundamental pillars: health, hygiene, awareness and spreading positivity. But how did we actually implement this? Well, we started within the walls of our school classroom. Instead of simply explaining menstruation to children from a textbook or biological standpoint, we adopted an innovative approach. We conducted an activity where students strung together a bracelet consisting of 28 beads signifying the length of the menstrual cycle, out of which four to seven beads were of a different color, demonstrating the days a woman bleeds. And in this way, we not only explained what periods are in a manner that was educational but also approachable and engaging. To offer another example, we explored various ways of alleviating cramps, including preparing some natural remedies in school itself. ",
    " And we didn't just stop at involving girls in our campaign. In fact, boys were equally involved, and one of our co-team members, as you saw, is also a boy. Through internal conversations where girls could freely share their personal experiences and boys could just ask questions, no matter how \"dumb\" they might seem, our male volunteers quickly got over their awkwardness, not just supporting but also leading educational sessions. Clearly, starting an inclusive conversation, including members of all genders and listening to and supporting each other, can go a long way. ",
    " Now, to make our campaign successful, we conducted extensive research, interviewed gynecologists, surveyed people to gauge public opinion on periods and conducted a panel discussion with professionals working in this field. And then we undertook the journey to create change. We organized a stall at Shilpotsav, a local fair, where we distributed sanitary napkin-shaped envelopes and bookmarks containing period-positive messages. We donated hundreds of pads that we had collected through a pad donation drive at school. Interacting with young girls in government and charitable schools, we explained periods to them through a game of hopscotch and distributed period kits that we had made ourselves that consisted of a pad and other items like a paper soap and sanitizer for maintaining hygiene, a piece of dark chocolate just to lift their mood, a sachet of ginger tea and so on. In whatever we did, we strived to think beyond the norm and break barriers, be it by creating a physical period tracker to help girls without access to the internet to record their monthly cycle, or sensitizing the masses by performing street plays, or even developing a video game called \"Crimson Crusade\" \u2014 ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " that introduces both boys and girls to problems faced by menstruating women globally and players progress in the game by defeating menstrual monsters. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " To sustain this effort, we've installed 10 sanitary napkin dispensers in several schools. Gradually, people's mindsets are changing. ",
    " But does change come so easily? At a school for the underprivileged, we encountered a girl who had just got her first period but wasn't wearing anything to absorb the flow. Imagine being her, sitting in class feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable, looking down and seeing red, asking your parents for help, asking what was going on with you and being dismissed. Imagine the shame, fear and embarrassment for being \"caught\" doing something wrong that forces you into living in ignorance and silence at the cost of your health and dignity. ",
    " While we do our part, our endeavors will only be successful if each one of you internalizes and spreads onward the idea that menstruation is completely normal, if each one of you conveys this message to every person you know. When we can discuss digestion, blood circulation and respiration \u2014 all natural, biological processes \u2014 why should menstruation be off-limits? And you, too, can help make it less taboo, simply by being more open with male friends and family members, supporting local and international organizations working to improve menstrual hygiene management, making menstrual bracelets with middle school kids in your area or even by playing Crimson Crusade with your friends. Every small steps counts, because brushing this topic under the carpet perpetuates lack of access to sanitary absorbents, ignorance of menstrual health issues, school absenteeism, infection and so much more. ",
    " I'd like to end with a few lines a volunteer wrote for us: \"Let the crimson tide turn. Let there be waves of positivity, thundering applause, villages full of women who bleed with pride. Let there be a scent of education drifting through the oxygen inhaled by men, women and children. Let all know the marvels of menstruation and celebrate Pravahkriti.\" ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " I'm here to talk about climate change, but I'm not really an environmentalist. In fact, I've never really thought of myself as a nature person. I have never gone camping, never gone hiking, never even owned a pet. I've lived my whole life in cities, actually just one city. And while I like to take trips to visit nature, I always thought it was something that was happening elsewhere, far away, with all of modern life a fortress against its forces. In other words, like just about everybody I knew, I lived my life complacent and deluded about the threat from global warming. Which I took to be happening slowly, happening at a distance and representing only a modest threat to the way that I lived. In each of these ways, I was very, very wrong. ",
    " Now most people, if they were telling you about climate change, will tell you a story about the future. If I was doing that, I would say, \"According to the UN, if we don't change course, by the end of the century, we're likely to get about four degrees Celsius of warming.\" That would mean, some scientists believe, twice as much war, half as much food, a global GDP possibly 20 percent smaller than it would be without climate change. That's an impact that's deeper than the Great Depression, and it would be permanent. ",
    " But the impacts are actually happening a lot faster than 2100. By just 2050, it's estimated, many of the biggest cities in South Asia and the Middle East will be almost literally unlivably hot in summer. These are cities that today are home to 10, 12, 15 million people. And in just three decades, you wouldn't be able to walk around outside in them without risking heatstroke or possibly death. ",
    " The planet is now 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization. That may not sound like a lot, but it actually puts us entirely outside the window of temperatures that enclose all of human history. That means that everything we have ever known as a species, the evolution of the human animal, the development of agriculture, the development of rudimentary civilization and modern civilization and industrial civilization, everything we know about ourselves as biological creatures, as social creatures, as political creatures, all of it is the result of climate conditions we have already left behind. It's like we've landed on an entirely different planet, with an entirely different climate. And we now have to figure out what of the civilization that we've brought with us can endure these new conditions and what can't. And things will get worse from here. ",
    " Now for a very long time, we were told that climate change was a slow saga. It started with the industrial revolution, and it had fallen to us to clean up the mess left by our grandparents so our grandchildren wouldn't be dealing with the results. It was a story of centuries. In fact, half of all of the emissions that have ever been produced from the burning of fossil fuels in the entire history of humanity have been produced in just the last 30 years. That's since Al Gore published his first book on warming. It's since the UN established its IPCC climate change body. We've done more damage since then than in all the centuries, all the millennia before. ",
    " Now I'm 37 years old, which means my life contains this entire story. When I was born, the planet's climate seemed stable. Today, we are on the brink of catastrophe. The climate crisis is not the legacy of our ancestors. It is the work of a single generation. Ours. ",
    " This may all sound like bad news. Which it is, really bad news. But it also contains, I think, some good news, at least relatively speaking. These impacts are terrifyingly large. But they are also, I think, exhilarating. Because they are ultimately a reflection of how much power we have over the climate. If we get to those hellish scenarios, it will be because we have made them happen, because we have chosen to make them happen. Which means we can choose to make other scenarios happen, too. ",
    " Now that may seem too rosy to believe and the political obstacles are in fact enormous. But it is a simple fact \u2014 the main driver of global warming is human action: How much carbon we put into the atmosphere. Our hands are on those levers. And we can write the story of the planet's climate future ourselves. Not just can \u2014 but are. Since inaction is a kind of action, we'll be writing that story ourselves whether we like it or not. This is not just any story, all of us holding the future of the planet in our hands. It's the kind of story we used to recognize only in mythology and theology. A single generation that has brought the future of humanity into doubt now tasked with securing a new future. ",
    " So what would that look like? It could mean solar arrays barnacling the planet, really everywhere you looked. It could mean if we developed better technology, we wouldn't even need to deploy them that broadly, because it's been estimated that just a sliver of the Sahara desert absorbs enough solar power to provide all the world's energy needs. But we'd probably need a new electric grid, one that doesn't lose two-thirds of its power to waste heat, as is today the case in the US. We could use some more nuclear power, perhaps, although it would have to be an entirely different kind of nuclear power, because today's technology simply isn't cost-competitive with renewable energy whose costs are falling so rapidly. ",
    " We'd need a new kind of plane, because I don't think it's particularly practical to ask the entire world to give up on air travel, especially as so much of the global South is, for the very first time, able to afford it. We need planes that won't produce carbon. We need a new kind of agriculture. Because we probably can't ask people to entirely give up on meat and go vegan, it would mean a new way of raising beef. Or perhaps an old way, since we already know that traditional pasturing practices can turn cattle farms from what are called carbon sources, which produce CO2, into carbon sinks, which absorb them. If you prefer a techno solution, maybe we can grow some of that mean in the lab. Probably, we could also feed some real cattle seaweed, because that cuts their methane emissions by as much as 95 or 99 percent. ",
    " Probably, we'd have to do all of these things, because as with every aspect of this puzzle, the problem is simply too vast and complicated to solve in any single silver-bullet way. ",
    " And no matter how many solutions we deploy, we probably won't be able to decarbonize in time. That's the terrifying math that we face. We won't be able to beat climate change, only live with it and limit it. And that means we'd probably need some amount of what are called negative emissions, which take carbon out of the atmosphere as well. Billions of new trees, maybe trillions of new trees. And whole plantations of carbon-capture machines. Perhaps an industry twice or four times the size of today's oil and gas business to undo the damage that was done by those businesses in past decades. ",
    " We would need a new kind of infrastructure, poured by a different kind of cement, because today, if cement were a country, it would be the world's third biggest emitter. And China is pouring as much cement every three years as the US poured in the entire 20th century. We would need to build seawalls and levees to protect those people living on the coast, many of whom are too poor to build them today, which is why it must mean an end to a narrowly nationalistic geopolitics that allows us to define the suffering of those living elsewhere in the world as insignificant, when we even acknowledge it. ",
    " This better future won't be easy. But the only obstacles are human ones. That may not be much of a comfort, if you know what I know about human brutality and indifference, but I promise you, it is better than the alternative. Science isn't stopping us from taking action, and neither is technology. We have the tools we need today to begin. Of course, we also have the tools we need to end global poverty, epidemic disease and the abuse of women as well. Which is why more than new tools, we need a new politics, a way of overcoming all those human obstacles \u2014 our culture, our economics, our status quo bias, our disinterest in taking seriously anything that really scares us. Our shortsightedness. Our sense of self-interest. And the selfishness of the world's rich and powerful who have the least incentive to change anything. Now, they will suffer too, but not as much as those with the least, who have done the least  to produce warming and have benefited the least from the processes that have brought us to this crisis point but will be burdened most in the decades ahead. A new politics would make the matter of managing that burden, where it falls and how heavily, the top priority of our time. ",
    " No matter what we do, climate change will transform modern life. Some amount of warming is already baked in and is inevitable, which means probably some amount of additional suffering is, too. And even if we take dramatic action and avoid some of these truly terrifying worst-case scenarios, it would mean living on an entirely different planet. With a new politics, a new economics, a new relationship to technology and a new relationship to nature \u2014 a whole new world. But a relatively livable one. Relatively prosperous. And green. Why not choose that one? ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " Can you hear me OK? ",
    " Audience: Yes. ",
    " Jim Hudspeth: OK. Well, if you can, it's really amazing, because my voice is changing the air pressure where you sit by just a few billionths of the atmospheric level, yet we take it for granted that your ears can capture that infinitesimal signal and use it to signal to the brain the full range of auditory experiences: the human voice, music, the natural world. How does your ear do that? And the answer to that is: through the cells that are the real hero of this presentation \u2014 the ear's sensory receptors, which are called \"hair cells.\" ",
    " Now, these hair cells are unfortunately named, because they have nothing at all to do with the kind of hair of which I have less and less. These cells were originally named that by early microscopists, who noticed that emanating from one end of the cell was a little cluster of bristles. With modern electron microscopy, we can see much better the nature of the special feature that gives the hair cell its name. That's the hair bundle. It's this cluster of 20 to several hundred fine cylindrical rods that stand upright at the top end of the cell. And this apparatus is what is responsible for your hearing me right this instant. ",
    " Now, I must say that I am somewhat in love with these cells. I've spent 45 years in their company \u2014 ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " and part of the reason is that they're really beautiful. There's an aesthetic component to it. Here, for example, are the cells with which an ordinary chicken conducts its hearing. These are the cells that a bat uses for its sonar. We use these large hair cells from a frog for many of our experiments. Hair cells are found all the way down to the most primitive of fishes, and those of reptiles often have this really beautiful, almost crystalline, order. ",
    " But above and beyond its beauty, the hair bundle is an antenna. It's a machine for converting sound vibrations into electrical responses that the brain can then interpret. At the top of each hair bundle, as you can see in this image, there's a fine filament connecting each of the little hairs, the stereocilia. It's here marked with a little red triangle. And this filament has at its base a couple of ion channels, which are proteins that span the membrane. ",
    " And here's how it works. This rat trap represents an ion channel. It has a pore that passes potassium ions and calcium ions. It has a little molecular gate that can be open, or it can be closed. And its status is set by this elastic band which represents that protein filament. Now, imagine that this arm represents one stereocilium and this arm represents the adjacent, shorter one with the elastic band between them. When sound energy impinges upon the hair bundle, it pushes it in the direction towards its taller edge. The sliding of the stereocilia puts tension in the link until the channels open and ions rush into the cell. When the hair bundle is pushed in the opposite direction, the channels close. And, most importantly, a back-and-forth motion of the hair bundle, as ensues during the application of acoustic waves, alternately opens and closes the channel, and each opening admits millions and millions of ions into the cell. Those ions constitute an electrical current that excites the cell. The excitation is passed to a nerve fiber, and then propagates into the brain. Notice that the intensity of the sound is represented by the magnitude of this response. A louder sound pushes the hair bundle farther, opens the channel longer, lets more ions in and gives rise to a bigger response. ",
    " Now, this mode of operation has the advantage of great speed. Some of our senses, such as vision, use chemical reactions that take time. And as a consequence of that, if I show you a series of pictures at intervals of 20 or 30 per second, you get the sense of a continuous image. Because it doesn't use reactions, the hair cell is fully 1,000 times faster than our other senses. We can hear sounds at frequencies as great as 20,000 cycles per second, and some animals have ever faster ears. The ears of bats and whales, for example, can respond to their sonar pulses at 150,000 cycles a second. ",
    " But this speed doesn't entirely explain why the ear performs so well. And it turns out that our hearing benefits from an amplifier, something called the \"active process.\" The active process enhances our hearing and makes possible all the remarkable features that I've already mentioned. ",
    " Let me tell you how it works. First of all, the active process amplifies sound, so you can hear, at threshold, sounds that move the hair bundle by a distance of only about three-tenths of a nanometer. That's the diameter of one water molecule. It's really astonishing. The system can also operate over an enormously wide dynamic range. Why do we need this amplification? The amplification, in ancient times, was useful because it was valuable for us to hear the tiger before the tiger could hear us. And these days, it's essential as a distant early warning system. It's valuable to be able to hear fire alarms or contemporary dangerous such as speeding fire engines or police cars or the like. When the amplification fails, our hearing's sensitivity plummets, and an individual may then need an electronic hearing aid to supplant the damaged biological one. ",
    " This active process also enhances our frequency selectivity. Even an untrained individual can distinguish two tones that differ by only two-tenths of a percent, which is one-thirtieth of the difference between two piano notes, and a trained musician can do even better. This fine discrimination is useful in our ability to distinguish different voices and to understand the nuances of speech. And, again, if the active process deteriorates, it becomes harder to carry out verbal communication. ",
    " Finally, the active process is valuable in setting the very broad range of sound intensities that our ears can tolerate, from the very faintest sound that you can hear, such as a dropped pen, to the loudest sound that you can stand \u2014 say, a jackhammer or a jet plane. The amplitude of sounds spans a range of one millionfold, which is more than is encompassed by any other sense or by any man-made device of which I'm aware. And again, if this system deteriorates, an affected individual may have a hard time hearing the very faintest sounds or tolerating the very loudest ones. ",
    " Now, to understand how the hair cell does its thing, one has to situate it within its environment within the ear. We learn in school that the organ of hearing is the coiled, snail-shaped cochlea. It's an organ about the size of a chickpea. It's embedded in the bone on either side of the skull. We also learn that an optical prism can separate white light into its constituent frequencies, which we see as distinct colors. In an analogous way, the cochlea acts as sort of an acoustic prism that splits apart complex sounds into their component frequencies. So when a piano is sounded, different notes blend together into a chord. ",
    " The cochlea undoes that process. It separates them and represents each at a different position. In this picture, you can see where three notes \u2014 middle C and the two extreme notes on a piano \u2014 are represented in the cochlea. The lowest frequencies go all the way up to the top of the cochlea. The highest frequencies, down to 20,000 Hz, go all the way to the bottom of the cochlea, and every other frequency is represented somewhere in between. And, as this diagram shows, successive musical tones are represented a few tens of hair cells apart along the cochlear surface. ",
    " Now, this separation of frequencies is really key in our ability to identify different sounds, because very musical instrument, every voice, emits a distinct constellation of tones. The cochlea separates those frequencies, and the 16,000 hair cells then report to the brain how much of each frequency is present. The brain can then compare all the nerve signals and decide what particular tone is being heard. ",
    " But this doesn't explain everything that I want to explain. Where's the magic? I told you already about the great things that the hair cell can do. How does it carry out the active process and do all the remarkable features that I mentioned at the outset? The answer is instability. We used to think that the hair bundle was a passive object, it just sat there, except when it was stimulated. But in fact, it's an active machine. It's constantly using internal energy to do mechanical work and enhance our hearing. So even at rest, in the absence of any input, an active hair bundle is constantly trembling. It's constantly twitching back and forth. But when even a weak sound is applied to it, it latches on to that sound and begins to move very neatly in a one-to-one way with it, and by so doing, it amplifies the signal about a thousand times. ",
    " This same instability also enhances our frequency selectivity, for a given hair cell tends to oscillate best at the frequency at which it normally trembles when it's not being stimulated. So, this apparatus not only gives us our remarkably acute hearing, but also gives us the very sharp tuning. ",
    " I want to offer you a short demonstration of something related to this. I'll ask the people who are running the sound system to turn up its sensitivity at one specific frequency. So just as a hair cell is tuned to one frequency, the amplifier will now enhance a particular frequency in my voice. Notice how specific tones emerge more clearly from the background. This is exactly what hair cells do. Each hair cell amplifies and reports one specific frequency and ignores all the others. And the whole set of hair cells, as a group, can then report to the brain exactly what frequencies are present in a given sound, and the brain can determine what melody is being heard or what speech is being intended. ",
    " Now, an amplifier such as the public address system can also cause problems. If the amplification is turned up too far, it goes unstable and begins to howl or emit sounds. And one wonders why the active process doesn't do the same thing. Why don't our ears beam out sounds? And the answer is that they do. In a suitably quiet environment, 70 percent of normal people will have one or more sounds coming out of their ears. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " I'll give you an example of this. You will hear two emissions at high frequencies coming from a normal human ear. You may also be able to discern background noise, like the microphone's hiss, the gurgling of a stomach, the heartbeat, the rustling of clothes. ",
    " (Hums, microphone hiss,  dampened taps, clothes rustling) ",
    " This is typical. Most ears emit just a handful of tones, but some can emit as many as 30. Every ear is unique, so my right ear is different from my left, my ear is different from your ear, but unless an ear is damaged, it continues to emit the same spectrum of frequencies over a period of years or even decades. ",
    " So what's going on? It turns out that the ear can control its own sensitivity, its own amplification. So if you're in a very loud environment, like a sporting event or a musical concert, you don't need any amplification, and the system is turned down all the way. If you are in a room like this auditorium, you might have a little bit of amplification, but of course the public address system does most of the work for you. And finally, if you go into a really quiet room where you can hear a pin drop, the system is turned up almost all the way. But if you go into an ultraquiet room such as a sound chamber, the system turns itself up to 11, it goes unstable and it begins to emit sound. And these emissions constitute a really strong demonstration of just how active the hair cell can be. ",
    " So in the last minute, I want to turn to another question that might come up, which is: Where do we go from here? And I would say that there are three issues that I would really like to address in the future. ",
    " The first is: What is the molecular motor that's responsible for the hair cell's amplification? Somehow, nature has stumbled across a system that can oscillate or amplify at 20,000 cycles per second, or even more. That's much faster than any other biological oscillation, and we would like to understand where it comes from. ",
    " The second issue is how the hair cell's amplification is adjusted to deal with the acoustic circumstances. Who turns the knob to increase or decrease the amplification in a quiet or in a loud environment? ",
    " And the third issue is one that concerns all of us, which is what we can do about the deterioration of our hearing. Thirty million Americans, and more than 400 million people worldwide, have significant problems on a daily basis with understanding speech in a noisy environment or over the telephone. Many have even worse deficits. Moreover, these deficits tend to get worse with time, because when human hair cells die, they're not replaced by cell division. But we know that nonmammalian animals can replace their cells, and those creatures' cells are dying and being replaced throughout life, so the animals maintain normal hearing. Here's an example from a little zebra fish. The cell at the top will undergo a division to produce two new hair cells. They dance for a little bit, and then settle down and go to work. ",
    " So we believe that if we can decode the molecular signals that are used by these other animals to regenerate their hair cells, we'll be able to do the same thing for humans. And our group and many other groups are now engaged in research trying to resurrect these amazing hair cells. ",
    " Thank you for your attention. ",
    " (Applause) "

    " Right now, the majority of you are wondering something. \"What happened to her?\" \"Why is she in a wheelchair?\" I think, subconsciously, people are hoping that I will talk about it. That I say what it is, tell them about it, open up about it. But the truth is, I've already had enough of it. I've had enough of everyone asking me. I've had enough of explaining it to everyone. So what I've decided to do lately is to start making things up. Every time someone has asked what happened, I make up a completely different story. Like I was attacked by a shark, I jumped off a cliff and survived. Or one time, a little boy asked me what had happened, and, very dramatically, I look at him and say to him, \"I'm just doing a social experiment to see how people react when confronted with a wheelchair.\" Very surprised, he looks at me and says, \"No way. Really? Let me see. Stand up.\" The experiment was completely ruined. (Laughter) I believe the problem is not that people are interested in knowing why I am in a wheelchair, that's just simply curiosity. I believe the problem is that they ask me about it before asking my name. For me, starting to use a wheelchair was like discovering a new world. A world that, in reality, was always there. Everyone sees it, but not everyone is familiar with it. For me, it was like a change of outlook, a change of routine. Just like any other big change that can occur in your life, whether it's, I don't know, having a kid, moving to another house, losing a loved one, or changing jobs, it's adapting to a new routine. I didn't stop doing things; I learned to do things differently. I believe - For me, it was like a change in perspective, really. I went from seeing the world from 5' 7\" to seeing it from the average height of an 8-year-old kid. The whole world started to be at a different height too. Mirrors, most of all. In 99% of mirrors, the only thing I can see is my forehead. And I come up to here. (Laughter) I discovered that there are things that are made for people like me. When I started to use a wheelchair, I stopped using the women's bathroom. I started going to a third bathroom, that bathroom that's made for people like me. I stopped entering places where everyone else went in, because most times the main entrances are not accessible. And the entrances for people like me are around the corner, the side door, through the utility room or the garage. I discovered the power of a ramp. For me, accessibility literally means opportunity. Whether or not there is a ramp up on the other side of the street, for me, means whether I can or can't cross over. But we live in a world where sometimes not many such opportunities exist. I had to change schools once I started using a wheelchair: the school I'd been attending my whole life had not been adapted in a way that would allow me to keep going to it. Also, one of the things I found the most difficult were the looks. When you're in a wheelchair and you go down the street, everyone is going to look at you. It's inevitable. You can't avoid someone noticing you went out today without combing your hair. You can't avoid not greeting someone that you don't feel like greeting. Everyone is going to look at you, or, on the other hand, avoid looking at you. But one of the things that still surprises me the most is that, sometimes, it's as if I feel the world is trying to save me. It's as if, subconsciously, I go down the street, and people give me saint cards. They invite me to pray to the saints. They recommend doctors. Or they feel the need to give me a message of support. Like, \"Everything's going to be fine,\" (Laughter) \"you can do it, if you really want to,\" (Laughter) or they congratulate my friends for being my friends. (Laughter) I don't get it. (Applause) I believe - Often I don't know how to react to these things because I know people indubitably do it with the best of intentions, But it makes me wonder what a wheelchair is associated with. What the big picture is. Yes, I am in a wheelchair, but ... I'm fine. I'm not worried about my life. I don't want anyone to come and save me. To me, one of the greatest ironies is that it doesn't matter where I am, what I'm doing, whom I'm with, whether I'm in a nightclub dancing the cumbia, people look at me ... and think, \"Wow, what genius!\" (Laughter) \"Wow, what an inspiration!\" (Laughter) \"What an example!\" (Laughter) I could be a serial killer who kills people at night, but, to the world, I'm an example. (Applause) And that makes me wonder: \"Why do people train, study, take such great pains to be someone in life?\" Better to buy a wheelchair; you become exemplary automatically. (Applause) Sometimes disability is like a taboo. Words are used to name that which is not named. When I sat myself in a wheelchair, automatically, to the world, I became a special person. I became an angel. I became a being of light. (Laughter) And I also came to have different capabilities. I've never really understood these different capabilities, because, I don't want to disappoint them, but I can't fly. (Laughter) I don't have superpowers. I believe the only way I'm differently abled to all of you is that I have a horn. (Horn) (Applause) I don't think any of you have a horn. A disability does not make you better or worse than anyone else. For me, getting used to a wheelchair was a process. A long process. But I always think that it would have been easier if I had met with an environment that had already been adapted, and for it not to have been me who had to adapt to the environment. Everything would have been easier if disability wasn't a taboo or a bad word. If people didn't think being in a wheelchair meant something was wrong. If being able to get a job, using a public convenience, or getting on a bus, did not have to be a privilege. Everything would be easier if people with disabilities could indeed be examples, could indeed be inspirations, but for their ideas, for their talents, for their passions; not for the mere fact that crossing the street is a challenge. I want to live in a world in which I can come here, I can talk to you for an hour about whatever, about whichever, and be able to leave here without any of you still wondering why, with everything that she said, she at no point told us why she is in a wheelchair. Thank you. (Applause) "

    " In their ramshackle hut  on the edge of the woods, a husband and wife were in despair. The woman had just given birth  to their thirteenth child, and the growing family was quickly  running out of food and money. ",
    " The father walked into the woods  to ponder their problem. After hours spent wandering  through the trees, he encountered two shadowy silhouettes. The first figure appeared  to be the man\u2019s God, while the second resembled the Devil. Both figures offered to lighten  the man\u2019s burden, and act as Godfather  to his most recent child. But the man refused their offer\u2014 he wouldn\u2019t entrust his son to those  who passed judgment on human life. ",
    " He ventured deeper  into the tangled thicket. Here in the darkest part of the woods,  the father made out a third figure. Sunken eyes stared out of its gaunt face,  which broke into a crooked smile. This was Death himself,  come to offer his services as Godfather. He promised to return  when the child came of age, to bring him happiness and prosperity. The father\u2014 knowing that all people  are equal in the eyes of Death\u2014 accepted his offer. ",
    " Years later, when the child had grown  into an ambitious young man, his skeletal Godfather  came for his promised visit. In his gnarled hand  he held a flask containing the cure for all human ailments. Death had brought this flask  for his Godson, promising to make him a successful doctor. But the powerful potion  came with very strict rules. ",
    " If his Godson encountered a sick person and Death was hovering  at the top of their bed, the doctor could heal them with  just a waft of the antidote\u2019s fumes. But if Death lingered  at the foot of the bed, he\u2019d already claimed the patient  as his own\u2014 and the doctor could do nothing for them. ",
    " In time, the doctor\u2019s potent potion  and uncanny instincts became known throughout the land. He grew rich and famous, casting off  the hardships of his early life. ",
    " When the king fell ill, he summoned  the famous physician to treat him. The doctor swept into the palace,  ready to show off his skills. But when he entered the king\u2019s chamber, he was dismayed to see Death  settled at the foot of the bed. ",
    " The doctor desperately wanted the glory  of saving the king\u2014 even if it meant deceiving his Godfather. And so, he swiftly spun the bed around  and reversed Death\u2019s position, leaving the doctor free  to administer the antidote. Death was livid. He warned his arrogant Godson  that if he ever cheated Death again, he would pay for it with his life. ",
    " Death and the doctor  continued their travels. After some time, the king\u2019s messengers  came to collect the doctor yet again. The princess was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible  riches to anyone who could cure her. ",
    " The doctor approached the princesses\u2019  chamber with gold in his eyes. But upon seeing the sleeping princess,  his greed fell away. He was so struck by her grace, that he failed to notice  Death lurking by her feet. He swiftly healed the princess, but before she could even utter  her thanks, Death had dragged  his lovesick Godson away. ",
    " In an instant,  the palace dissolved around them. The doctor found himself  in an immense cave lined with countless quivering candles, each representing the duration of a life. As punishment for his Godson\u2019s  foolish attempt to master mortality, Death whittled his candle  down to its wick. ",
    " Seeing his own dwindling light, the doctor felt the fear  he\u2019d often glimpsed in his patients\u2019 eyes. Desperately, he begged Death to transfer  his dying light onto a new candle. His Godfather considered the request\u2014  but the doctor\u2019s betrayal was too great. He loosened his bony grip,  and his Godson\u2019s candle fell to the floor. Death stood motionless, his inscrutable face  fixed on the sputtering flame\u2014 until all that was left of the doctor  was a wisp of smoke. "

    " The minute she said it, the temperature in my classroom dropped. My students are usually laser-focused on me, but they shifted in their seats and looked away. ",
    " I'm a black woman who teaches the histories of race and US slavery. I'm aware that my social identity is always on display. And my students are vulnerable too, so I'm careful. I try to anticipate what part of my lesson might go wrong. But honestly, I didn't even see this one coming. None of my years of graduate school prepared me for what to do when the N-word entered my classroom. ",
    " I was in my first year of teaching when the student said the N-word in my class. She was not calling anyone a name. She was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. She came to class with her readings done, she sat in the front row and she was always on my team. When she said it, she was actually making a point about my lecture, by quoting a line from a 1970s movie, a comedy, that had two racist slurs. One for people of Chinese descent and the other the N-word. As soon as she said it, I held up my hands, said, \"Whoa, whoa.\" But she assured me, \"It's a joke from 'Blazing Saddles,'\" and then she repeated it. ",
    " This all happened 10 years ago, and how I handled it haunted me for a long time. It wasn't the first time I thought about the word in an academic setting. I'm a professor of US history, it's in a lot of the documents that I teach. So I had to make a choice. After consulting with someone I trusted, I decided to never say it. Not even to quote it. But instead to use the euphemistic phrase, \"the N-word.\" Even this decision was complicated. I didn't have tenure yet, and I worried that senior colleagues would think that by using the phrase I wasn't a serious scholar. But saying the actual word still felt worse. ",
    " The incident in my classroom forced me to publicly reckon with the word. The history, the violence, but also \u2014 The history, the violence, but also any time it was hurled at me, spoken casually in front of me, any time it rested on the tip of someone's tongue, it all came flooding up in that moment, right in front of my students. And I had no idea what to do. ",
    " So I've come to call stories like mine points of encounter. A point of encounter describes the moment you came face-to-face with the N-word. If you've even been stumped or provoked by the word, whether as the result of an awkward social situation, an uncomfortable academic conversation, something you heard in pop culture, or if you've been called the slur, or witnessed someone getting called the slur, you have experienced a point of encounter. And depending on who you are and how that moment goes down, you might have a range of responses. Could throw you off a little bit, or it could be incredibly painful and humiliating. I've had lots of these points of encounter in my life, but one thing is true. There's not a lot of space to talk about them. ",
    " That day in my classroom was pretty much like all of those times I had an uninvited run-in with the N-word. I froze. Because the N-word is hard to talk about. Part of the reason the N-word is so hard to talk about, it's usually only discussed in one way, as a figure of speech, we hear this all the time, right? It's just a word. The burning question that cycles through social media is who can and cannot say it. Black intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates does a groundbreaking job of defending the African American use of the word. On the other hand, Wendy Kaminer, a white freedom of speech advocate, argues that if we don't all just come and say it, we give the word power. And a lot of people feel that way. The Pew Center recently entered the debate. In a survey called \"Race in America 2019,\" researchers asked US adults if they thought is was OK for a white person to say the N-word. Seventy percent of all adults surveyed said \"never.\" ",
    " And these debates are important. But they really obscure something else. They keep us from getting underneath to the real conversation. Which is that the N-word is not just a word. It's not neatly contained in a racist past, a relic of slavery. Fundamentally, the N-word is an idea disguised as a word: that black people are intellectually, biologically and immutably inferior to white people. And \u2014 and I think this is the most important part \u2014 that that inferiority means that the injustice we suffer and inequality we endure is essentially our own fault. So, yes, it is ... ",
    " Speaking of the word only as racist spew or as an obscenity in hip hop music makes it sounds as if it's a disease located in the American vocal cords that can be snipped right out. It's not, and it can't. And I learned this from talking to my students. ",
    " So next time class met, I apologized, and I made an announcement. I would have a new policy. Students would see the word in my PowerPoints, in film, in essays they read, but we would never ever say the word out loud in class. Nobody ever said it again. But they didn't learn much either. Afterwards, what bothered me most was that I didn't even explain to students why, of all the vile, problematic words in American English, why this particular word had its own buffer, the surrogate phrase \"the N-word.\" ",
    " Most of my students, many of them born in the late 1990s and afterwards, didn't even know that the phrase \"the N-word\" is a relatively new invention in American English. When I was growing up, it didn't exist. But in the late 1980s, black college students, writers, intellectuals, more and more started to talk about racist attacks against them. But increasingly, when they told these stories, they stopped using the word. Instead, they reduced it to the initial N and called it \"the N-word.\" They felt that every time the word was uttered it opened up old wounds, so they refused to say it. They knew their listeners would hear the actual word in their heads. That wasn't the point. The point was they didn't want to put the word in their own mouths or into the air. By doing this, they made an entire nation start to second-guess themselves about saying it. This was such a radical move that people are still mad about it. Critics accuse those of us who use the phrase \"the N-word,\" or people who become outraged, you know, just because the word is said, of being overprincipled, politically correct or, as I just read a couple of weeks ago in The New York Times, \"insufferably woke.\" Right? ",
    " So I bought into this a little bit too, which is why the next time I taught the course I proposed a freedom of speech debate. The N-word in academic spaces, for or against? I was certain students would be eager to debate who gets to say it and who doesn't. But they weren't. Instead ... my students started confessing. A white student from New Jersey talked about standing by as a black kid at her school got bullied by this word. She did nothing and years later still carried the guilt. Another from Connecticut talked about the pain of severing a very close relationship with a family member, because that family member refused to stop saying the word. ",
    " One of the most memorable stories came from a very quiet black student from South Carolina. She didn't understand all the fuss. She said everyone at her school said the word. She wasn't talking about kids calling each other names in the hall. She explained that at her school when teachers and administrators became frustrated with an African American student, they called that student the actual N-word. She said it didn't bother her at all. But then a couple of days later, she came to visit me in my office hours and wept. She thought she was immune. She realized that she wasn't. ",
    " Over the last 10 years, I have literally heard hundreds of these stories from all kinds of people from all ages. People in their 50s remembering stories from the second grade and when they were six, either calling people the word or being called the word, but carrying that all these years around this word, you know. And as I listened to people talk about their points of encounter, the pattern that emerged for me as a teacher that I found most upsetting is the single most fraught site for these points of encounter is the classroom. ",
    " Most US kids are going to meet the N-word in class. One of the most assigned books in US high schools is Mark Twain\u2019s \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" in which the word appears over 200 times. And this isn't an indictment of \"Huck Finn.\" The word is in lots of US literature and history. It's all over African American literature. Yet I hear from students that when the word is said during a lesson without discussion and context, it poisons the entire classroom environment. The trust between student and teacher is broken. Even so, many teachers, often with the very best of intentions, still say the N-word in class. They want to show and emphasize the horrors of US racism, so they rely on it for shock value. Invoking it brings into stark relief the ugliness of our nation's past. But they forget the ideas are alive and well in our cultural fabric. ",
    " The six-letter word is like a capsule of accumulated hurt. Every time it is said, every time, it releases into the atmosphere the hateful notion that black people are less. My black students tell me that when the word is quoted or spoken in class, they feel like a giant spotlight is shining on them. One of my students told me that his classmates were like bobbleheads, turning to gauge his reaction. A white student told me that in the eighth grade, when they were learning \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and reading it out loud in class, the student was stressed out at the idea of having to read the word, which the teacher insisted all students do, that the student ended up spending most of the unit hiding out in the bathroom. ",
    " This is serious. Students across the country talk about switching majors and dropping classes because of poor teaching around the N-word. The issue of faculty carelessly speaking the word has reached such a fevered pitch, it's led to protests at Princeton, Emory, The New School, Smith College, where I teach, and Williams College, where just recently students have boycotted the entire English Department over it and other issues. And these were just the cases that make the news. This is a crisis. And while student reaction looks like an attack on freedom of speech, I promise this is an issue of teaching. ",
    " My students are not afraid of materials that have the N-word in it. They want to learn about James Baldwin and William Faulkner and about the civil rights movement. In fact, their stories show that this word is a central feature of their lives as young people in the United States. It's in the music they love. And in the popular culture they emulate, the comedy they watch, it's in TV and movies and memorialized in museums. They hear it in locker rooms, on Instagram, in the hallways at school, in the chat rooms of the video games they play. It is all over the world they navigate. But they don't know how to think about it or even really what the word means. ",
    " I didn't even really understand what the word meant until I did some research. I was astonished to learn that black people first incorporated the N-word into the vocabulary as political protest, not in the 1970s or 1980s but as far back as the 1770s. And I wish I had more time to talk about the long, subversive history of the black use of the N-word. But I will say this: Many times, my students will come up to me and say, \"I understand the virulent roots of this word, it's slavery.\" They are only partially right. This word, which existed before it became a slur, but it becomes a slur at a very distinct moment in US history, and that's as large numbers of black people begin to become free, starting in the North in the 1820s. In other words, this word is fundamentally an assault on black freedom, black mobility, and black aspiration. ",
    " Even now, nothing so swiftly unleashes an N-word tirade as a black person asserting their rights or going where they please or prospering. Think of the attacks on Colin Kaepernick when he kneeled. Or Barack Obama when he became president. My students want to know this history. But when they ask questions, they're shushed and shamed. By shying away from talking about the N-word, we have turned this word into the ultimate taboo, crafting it into something so tantalizing, that for all US kids, no matter their racial background, part of their coming of age is figuring out how to negotiate this word. We treat conversations about it like sex before sex education. We're squeamish, we silence them. So they learn about it from misinformed friends and in whispers. ",
    " I wish I could go back to the classroom that day and push through my fear to talk about the fact that something actually happened. Not just to me or to my black students. But to all of us. You know, I think we're all connected by our inability to talk about this word. But what if we explored our points of encounter and did start to talk about it? ",
    " Today, I try to create the conditions in my classroom to have open and honest conversations about it. One of those conditions \u2014 not saying the word. We're able to talk about it because it doesn't come into the classroom. Another important condition is I don't make my black students responsible for teaching their classmates about this. That is my job. So I come prepared. I hold the conversation with a tight rein, and I'm armed with knowledge of the history. I always ask students the same question: Why is talking about the N-word hard? Their answers are amazing. They're amazing. More than anything though, I have become deeply acquainted with my own points of encounter, my personal history around this word. Because when the N-word comes to school, or really anywhere, it brings with it all of the complicated history of US racism. The nation's history and my own, right here, right now. There's no avoiding it. ",

    " This is the sound of orcas off the coast of Vancouver. ",
    " (Whale chirps and squeaks) ",
    " They make these fantastic sounds not just to communicate, but also sometimes to echolocate, to find their way around and to find food. But that can be tricky sometimes, because, well, here is the sound of a ship passing by, recorded underwater. ",
    " (Screeching oscillating sound) ",
    " You know, when we think about marine pollution, I think we usually think about plastics. Maybe toxic chemicals, or even ocean acidification from climate change. As a science journalist who often writes about environmental issues, those are the things that have passed my desk over the past 10 years or so. But as I recently realized when I was writing a feature for the science journal \"Nature,\" noise is another important kind of pollution. One that often gets ignored. ",
    " You know, maybe you've heard of the dark-skies movement, which aimed to raise awareness of the issue of light pollution and create pockets of unilluminated night, so that people and animals could enjoy more natural cycles of light and dark, night and day. Well, in much the same way, there are people now raising awareness of the issue of noise pollution and trying to create pockets of quiet in the ocean, so that marine life can enjoy a more natural soundscape. ",
    " This is important. Noise isn't just an irritation. It can cause chronic stress, or even physical injury. It can affect marine life's ability to find food and mates and to listen out for predators and more. Think of all the sounds we inject into the ocean. Perhaps one of the most dramatic is the seismic surveys used to look for oil and gas. Air guns produce loud blasts, sometimes every 10 to 15 seconds, for months on end. And they use the reflections of these sounds to map the ground beneath. It can sound like this. ",
    " (Explosion sounds) ",
    " Then, there's the sound of the actual drilling for oil and gas, the construction of things like offshore wind farms, sonar and of course, the nearly constant drone from more than 50,000 ships in the global merchant fleet. ",
    " Now the natural ocean itself isn't exactly quiet. If you put your head under the water, you can hear cracking ice, wind, rain, singing whales, grunting fish, even snapping shrimp. Altogether, that can create a soundscape of maybe 50 to 100 decibels, depending on where and when you are. ",
    " But mankind's addition to that has been dramatic. It's estimated that shipping has added three decibels of noise to the ocean every 10 years in recent decades. That might not sound like a lot, but decibels are on a logarithmic scale, like the Richter scale for earthquakes. So a small number can actually represent a large change. Three decibels means a doubling of noise intensity in the ocean. A doubling. ",
    " And that's only an estimate, because no one is actually keeping track of how noisy the ocean is all around the world. There is a body called the International Quiet Ocean Experiment, and one of their missions is to try and plug the hole in that data. So for example, last year, they managed to convince the Global Ocean Observation System to start including noise as one of their essential variables for monitoring, alongside things like temperature and salinity. ",
    " We do know some things. We know that sonar can be as loud, or nearly as loud, as an underwater volcano. A supertanker can be as loud as the call of a blue whale. The noises we add to the ocean come in all different frequencies and can travel great distances. Seismic surveys off the East Coast of the United States can be heard in the middle of the Atlantic. In the 1960s, they did an experiment where they set off a loud noise off the coast of Perth, Australia, and they detected it as far away as Bermuda, 20,000 kilometers away. ",
    " So what does all this sound like to marine life, what do they hear? It's kind of difficult to describe. Sound travels further, faster in water than it does in air, and it also packs a different punch. So sound of the same pressure will have a different intensity whether you measure it in the air or underwater. Then there's the fact that whales don't have ears exactly like human ears. Creatures like zooplankton don't even have what you would consider to be ears. So what does this mean, what is the impact on all this marine life? ",
    " Perhaps the easiest thing for scientists to assess is the effect of acute noise, really loud sudden blasts that might cause physical injury or hearing loss. Beaked whales, for example, can go into panicked dives when exposed to loud noises, which may even give them a condition similar to the bends. In the 1960s, after the introduction of more powerful sonar technologies, the number of incidents of mass whale strandings of beaked whales went up dramatically. And it's not just marine mammals, fish, if they stray too close to the source of a loud sound, their fish bladders may actually explode. The airgun blasts from seismic surveys can mow down a swath of zooplankton, the tiny creatures near the base of the food chain, or can deform scallop larvae while they're developing. ",
    " Well, what about chronic noise, the more pervasive issue of raising background noise from things like shipping? That can mask or drown out the natural soundscape. Some whales have responded to this by literally changing their tune, a little bit like people shouting to be heard in a noisy nightclub. And some fish will spend more time patrolling their borders and less time caring for their young, as if they're on high alert. ",
    " Chronic noise can affect people too, of course. Studies have shown that people living near busy airports or really busy highways may have elevated levels of cardiovascular disease. And students living under busy flight paths may do worse on some educational tests. And even while I was researching this subject, they were actually blasting out about three meters of solid granite from the lot across from my home office to make room for a new house, and the constant jittering of the rock hammer was driving me completely insane. And whenever the workers stopped for a moment, I could feel my shoulders relax. ",
    " This effect has been seen in whales, too. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, international shipping largely ground to a halt for a little while in the waters off the East Coast of the United States. And in that lull, researchers noticed that endangered right whales in that region had fewer chemical markers of stress in their feces samples. As one researcher I spoke to likes to say, \"We were stressed, but the whales weren't.\" ",
    " Now you have to remember, we have evolved to be a visual species. We really rely on our eyes. But marine life relies on sound the way that we rely on sight. For them, a noisy ocean may be as befuddling and even dangerous as a dense fog is for us. And maybe sometimes that just means being a little more stressed, maybe sometimes it means spending a little less time with the kids. Maybe some species can adapt. But some researchers worry that for endangered species already on the brink, noise may be enough to push them over the edge. ",
    " So take, for example, the southern resident killer whales that live in the waters off my hometown of Vancouver. There are only 75, maybe 76, animals left in this population. And they're facing a lot of challenges. There are chemical pollutants in these waters, and they are running low on the salmon that they really rely on for food. And then there's noise. When researchers studied these and similar killer whales, they found that they spend between 18 and 25 percent less time feeding in the presence of loud boat noise. And that's a lot for a species that's already struggling to find enough food to thrive. ",
    " The good news, as I heard from all the researchers I spoke to, is that you can do something relatively easily about ocean noise. Unlike the wicked problems of climate change and ocean acidification, you can just dial down the knob on ocean noise and see almost immediate impacts. So for example, in 2017, the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority started asking ships to simply slow down when going through the Haro Strait, where the southern resident killer whales are feeding in late summer. Slower ships are quieter ships. And because it's Canada, you can just ask, it can be voluntary. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " In that 2017 trial, most of the ships complied, adding about half an hour to their travel time, and reducing noise by about 1.2 decibels or 24 percent of noise intensity. This year, they decided to extend the length of time and the area over which they're asking ships to slow down. So hopefully that has a positive impact for these whales. ",
    " In 2017, the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority also introduced discounts in docking fees for ships that are physically designed to be quieter. You know, weirdly, a lot of the noise from a ship like this comes from the popping of tiny bubbles off the back of its propeller. And you can simply design a ship to do less of that and to be quieter. The International Maritime Organization has published a huge list of ways that boats can be made quieter. And they also have a target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from global shipping by 50 percent by 2050. And the great news is that these two things go hand in hand. On the whole, a more efficient ship is a quieter ship. ",
    " People have also invented quieter ways of hammering in the giant posts needed for giant wind turbines, like this one, and gentler ways of doing seismic surveys. And there are some incentives for using quieter technologies. The European Union, for example, has a healthy marine system directive for 2020. And one of the ways that they define a healthy marine system is by how much noise is going in those waters. But on the whole, most waters remain completely unregulated when it comes to ocean noise. ",
    " But again, most of the scientists I spoke to said that there's real momentum right now in policy circles to pay attention to this issue and maybe do something about this issue. We already know enough to say that quieter seas are healthier seas. But now scientists are really scrambling to come up with the details. Just how quiet do we need to be? And where are the best places to make quiet or preserve quiet? And how best can we hush our noise? ",
    " And you know, I'm not trying to tell you that noise is the biggest environmental problem on the planet or even in the ocean. But the point is that humankind has a lot of impacts on our environmental system. And these impacts don't act in isolation. They act together, and they multiply. So even for the ones that are not so obvious, we really need to pay attention to them. ",
    " I'll tell you about one last experiment, just because it's so beautiful. So Rob Williams, one of the researchers who works on southern resident killer whales, also does some work in Bali. And there, they celebrate a Hindu tradition called nyepi, or a day of silence. And this day, apparently, is very strictly observed. No planes take off from the airport, no boats go out fishing, the tourists are gently led off the beach back into their hotel rooms. And Rob Williams put some hydrophones in the water there to see what the impact was, and it was dramatic. Sound levels dropped by six to nine decibels, about the same as in the waters after 9/11. For an \"acoustic prospector\" like Williams, which is what he calls himself, this silence is golden. Now he and other researchers can go back to this place and see what the fish choose to do with all this additional acoustic real estate. ",
    " (Soft bubbling) ",
    " I like to think of them having their own holiday, feasting and finding mates. Celebrating their own spot of calm in an otherwise noisy world. ",
    " Thank you. ",
    " (Applause) "

    " At the age of 21, Simone de Beauvoir  became the youngest person to take the philosophy exams at France\u2019s most esteemed university. She passed with flying colors. But as soon as she mastered  the rules of philosophy, she wanted to break them. She\u2019d been schooled  on Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms, which dismissed the physical world  as a flawed reflection of higher truths and unchanging ideals. But for de Beauvoir,  earthly life was enthralling, sensual, and anything but static. Her desire to explore the physical world  to its fullest would shape her life, and eventually,  inspire a radical new philosophy. ",
    " Endlessly debating with her romantic  and intellectual partner Jean Paul Sartre, de Beauvoir explored free will, desire,  rights and responsibilities, and the value of personal experience. In the years following WWII, these ideas would converge  into the school of thought most closely associated with their work:  existentialism. ",
    " Where Judeo-Christian traditions  taught that humans are born with preordained purpose, de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed  a revolutionary alternative. They argued that humans are born free, and thrown into existence  without a divine plan. As de Beauvoir acknowledged, this freedom  is both a blessing and a burden. In \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\" she argued  that our greatest ethical imperative is to create our own life\u2019s meaning, while protecting the freedom  of others to do the same. As de Beauvoir wrote, \u201cA freedom which is interested only  in denying freedom must be denied.\u201d ",
    " This philosophy challenged its students  to navigate the ambiguities and conflicts our desires produce,  both internally and externally. And as de Beauvoir sought to find  her own purpose, she began to question: if everyone deserves  to freely pursue meaning, why was she restricted by society\u2019s ideals of womanhood? ",
    " Despite her prolific writing,  teaching and activism, de Beauvoir struggled  to be taken seriously by her male peers. She\u2019d rejected her Catholic upbringing  and marital expectations to study at university, and write memoirs, fiction and philosophy. But the risks she was taking  by embracing this lifestyle were lost on many  of her male counterparts, who took these freedoms for granted. They had no intellectual interest  in de Beauvoir\u2019s work, which explored women\u2019s inner lives, as well the author\u2019s open relationship  and bisexuality. To convey the importance  of her perspective, de Beauvoir embarked  on her most challenging book yet. Just as she\u2019d created the foundations  of existentialism, she\u2019d now redefine the limits of gender. ",
    " Published in 1949, \"The Second Sex\"  argues that, like our life\u2019s meaning, gender is not predestined. As de Beauvoir famously wrote, \u201cone is not born, but rather becomes,  woman.\u201d And to \u201cbecome\u201d a woman, she argued,  was to become the Other. De Beauvoir defined Othering  as the process of labeling women as less than the men who\u2019d  historically defined, and been defined as, the ideal human subjects. As the Other, she argued that women  were considered second to men, and therefore systematically restricted  from pursuing freedom. ",
    " \"The Second Sex\" became  an essential feminist treatise, offering a detailed history  of women\u2019s oppression and a wealth of anecdotal testimony. \"The Second Sex\"\u2019s combination  of personal experience and philosophical intervention provided a new language  to discuss feminist theory. Today, those conversations are still  informed by de Beauvoir\u2019s insistence that in the pursuit of equality, \u201cthere is no divorce between  philosophy and life.\u201d ",
    " Of course, like any foundational work, the ideas in \"The Second Sex\" have been  expanded upon since its publication. Many modern thinkers have explored  additional ways people are Othered that de Beauvoir doesn\u2019t acknowledge. These include racial  and economic identities, as well as the broader spectrum of gender  and sexual identities we understand today. ",
    " De Beauvoir\u2019s legacy  is further complicated by accusations of sexual misconduct  by two of her university students. In the face of these accusations, she had her teaching license revoked  for abusing her position. ",
    " In this aspect and others,  de Beauvoir\u2019s life remains controversial\u2014 and her work represents a contentious  moment in the emergence of early feminism. She participated in those conversations  for the rest of her life; writing fiction, philosophy,  and memoirs until her death in 1986. Today, her work offers  a philosophical language to be reimagined, revisited  and rebelled against\u2014 a response this revolutionary thinker  might have welcomed. "

    " Women are works of art. On the outside as on the inside. I am a neuroscientist, and I focus on the inside, especially on women's brains. ",
    " There are many theories on how women's brains differ from men's brains, and I've been looking at brains for 20 years and can guarantee that there is no such thing as a gendered brain. Pink and blue, Barbie and Lego, those are all inventions that have nothing to do with the way our brains are built. ",
    " That said, women's brains differ from men's brains in some respects. And I'm here to talk about these differences, because they actually matter for our health. For example, women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or depression, not to mention headaches and migraines. But also, at the core of my research, women are more likely than men to have Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia on the planet, affecting close to six million people in the United States alone. But almost two thirds of all those people are actually women. So for every man suffering from Alzheimer's there are two women. So why is that overall? Is it age? Is it lifespan? What else could it be? ",
    " A few years ago, I launched the Women's Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, exactly to answer those questions. And tonight, I'm here with some answers. ",
    " So it turns out our brains age differently, and menopause plays a key role here for women. Now most people think of the brain as a kind of black box, isolated from the rest of the body. But in reality, our brains are in constant interaction with the rest of us. And perhaps surprisingly, the interactions with the reproductive system are crucial for brain aging in women. These interactions are mediated by our hormones. And we know that hormones differ between the genders. ",
    " Men have more testosterone, women have more estrogens. But what really matters here is that these hormones differ in their longevity. Men's testosterone doesn't run out until late in life, which is a slow and pretty much symptom-free process, of course. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Women's estrogens, on the other hand, start fading in midlife, during menopause, which is anything but symptom-free. We associate menopause with the ovaries, but when women say that they're having hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, memory lapses, depression, anxiety, those symptoms don't start in the ovaries. They start in the brain. Those are neurological symptoms. We're just not used to thinking about them as such. So why is that? Why are our brains impacted by menopause? ",
    " Well, first of all, our brains and ovaries are part of the neuroendocrine system. As part of the system, the brain talks to the ovaries and the ovaries talk back to the brain, every day of our lives as women. So the health of the ovaries is linked to the health of the brain. And the other way around. At the same time, hormones like estrogen are not only involved in reproduction, but also in brain function. And estrogen in particular, or estradiol, is really key for energy production in the brain. ",
    " At the cellular level, estrogen literally pushes neurons to burn glucose to make energy. If your estrogen is high, your brain energy is high. When your estrogen declines though, your neurons start slowing down and age faster. And studies have shown that this process can even lead to the formation of amyloid plaques, or Alzheimer's plaques, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. ",
    " These effects are stronger in specific brain regions, starting with the hypothalamus, which is in charge of regulating body temperature. When estrogen doesn't activate the hypothalamus correctly, the brain cannot regulate body temperature correctly. So those hot flashes that women get, that's the hypothalamus. Then there's the brain stem, in charge of sleep and wake. When estrogen doesn't activate the brain stem correctly, we have trouble sleeping. Or it's the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain, close to the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain. When estrogen levels ebb in these regions, we start getting mood swings perhaps and forget things. So this is the brain anatomy of menopause, if you will. ",
    " But let me show you what an actual woman's brain can look like. So this is a kind of brain scan called positron emission tomography or PET. It looks at brain energy levels. And this is what you want your brain to look like when you're in your 40s. Really nice and bright. Now this brain belongs to a woman who was 43 years old when she was first scanned, before menopause. And this is the same brain just eight years later, after menopause. If we put them side by side, I think you can easily see how the bright yellow turned orange, almost purple. That's a 30 percent drop in brain energy levels. ",
    " Now in general, this just doesn't seem to happen to a man of the same age. In our studies with hundreds of people, we show that middle-aged men usually have high brain energy levels. For women, brain energy is usually fine before menopause, but then it gradually declines during the transition. And this was found independent of age. It didn't matter if the women were 40, 50 or 60. What mattered most was that they were in menopause. ",
    " So of course we need more research to confirm this, but it looks like  women's brains in midlife are more sensitive to hormonal aging than just straight up chronological aging. And this is important information to have, because so many women can feel these changes. So many of our patients have said to me that they feel like their minds are playing tricks on them, to put it mildly. So I really want to validate this, because it's real. And so just to clarify, if this is you, you are not crazy. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Thank you. ",
    " It's important. So many women have worried that they might be losing their minds. But the truth is that your brain might be going through a transition, or is going through a transition and needs time and support to adjust. Also, if anyone is concerned that middle-aged women might be underperformers, I'll just quickly add that we looked at cognitive performance, God forbid, right? ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Let's not do that. But we looked at cognitive performance, and we found absolutely no differences between men and women before and after menopause. And other studies confirm this. So basically, we may be tired, but we are just as sharp. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Get that out of the way. ",
    " That all said, there is something else more serious that deserves our attention. If you remember, I mentioned that estrogen declines could potentially promote the formation of amyloid plaques, or Alzheimer's plaques. But there's another kind of brain scan that looks exactly at those plaques. And we used it to show that middle-aged men hardly have any, which is great. But for women, there's quite a bit of an increase during the transition to menopause. And I want to be really, really clear here that not all women develop the plaques, and not all women with the plaques develop dementia. Having the plaques is a risk factor, it is not in any way a diagnosis, especially at this stage. ",
    " But still, it's quite an insight to associate Alzheimer's with menopause. We think of menopause as belonging to middle age and Alzheimer's as belonging to old age. But in reality, many studies, including my own work, had shown that Alzheimer's disease starts with negative changes in the brain years, if not decades, prior to clinical symptoms. So for women, it looks like this process starts in midlife, during menopause. Which is important information to have, because it gives us a time line to start looking for those changes. ",
    " So in terms of a time line, most women go through menopause in their early 50s. But it can be earlier, often because of medical interventions. And the common example is a hysterectomy and/or an oophorectomy, which is the surgical removal of the uterus and/or the ovaries. And unfortunately, there is evidence that having the uterus and, more so, the ovaries removed prior to menopause correlates with the higher risk of dementia in women. And I know that this is upsetting news, and it's definitely depressing news, but we need to talk about it because most women are not aware of this correlation, and it seems like very important information to have. ",
    " Also, no one is suggesting that women decline these procedures if they need them. The point here is that we really need to better understand what happens to our brains as we go through menopause, natural or medical, and how to protect our brains in the process. ",
    " So how do we do that? How do we protect our brains? Should we take hormones? That's a fair question, it's a good question. And the shortest possible answer right now is that hormonal therapy can be helpful to alleviate a number of symptoms, like hot flashes, but it's not currently recommended for dementia prevention. And many of us are working on testing different formulations and different dosages and different time lines, and hopefully, all this work will lead to a change in recommendations in the future. ",
    " Meanwhile, there are other things that we can do today to support our hormones and their effects on the brain that do not require medications but do require taking a good look at our lifestyle. That's because the foods we eat, how much exercise we get, how much sleep we get or don't get, how much stress we have in our lives, those are all things that can actually impact our hormones \u2014 for better and for worse. ",
    " Food, for example. There are many diets out there, but studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet in particular is supportive of women's health. Women on this diet have a much lower risk of cognitive decline, of depression, of heart disease, of stroke and of cancer, and they also have fewer hot flashes. What's interesting about this diet is that it's quite rich in foods that contain estrogens in the form of phytoestrogens or estrogens from plants that act like mild estrogens in our bodies. Some phytoestrogens have been linked to a possible risk of cancer, but not the ones in this diet, which are safe. Especially from flax seeds, sesame seeds, dried apricots, legumes and a number of fruits. And for some good news, dark chocolate contains phytoestrogens, too. ",
    " So diet is one way to gain estrogens, but it's just as important to avoid things that suppress our estrogens instead, especially stress. Stress can literally steal your estrogens, and that's because cortisol, which is the main stress hormone, works in balance with our estrogens. So if cortisol goes up, your estrogens go down. If cortisol goes down, your estrogens go back up. So reducing stress is really important. It doesn't just help your day, it also helps your brain. ",
    " So these are just a few things that we can do to support our brains and there are more. But the important thing here is that changing the way we understand the female brain really changes the way that we care for it, and the way that we frame women's health. And the more women demand this information, the sooner we'll be able to break the taboos around menopause, and also come up with solutions that actually work, not just for Alzheimer's disease, but for women's brain health as a whole. Brain health is women's health. ",
    " Thank you. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Thank you. Oh, thank you. "

    " Hi everybody. My name is Matt Cutts, and I worked at Google for almost 17 years. As a distinguished engineer there, I was pretty close to the top of the Silicon Valley ecosystem. ",
    " Then I decided to follow some inspiring folks and do a short tour at the US Digital Service. That's the group of geeks that helped rescue HealthCare.gov when that website went down hard in 2013. Yeah. So I signed up for a three-to-six-month tour, and almost three years later, I'm still in Washington DC, working for the federal government, because the government really needs technologists right now. ",
    " At my old job, every room had videoconferencing integrated with calendars, power cables were built right into the furniture. When I moved to a government agency, I had to call a person to set up a phone conference. And when we moved to a new office, we didn't have furniture for a while, so we set up the phone on a trash can. ",
    " One of the things that surprised me, whenever I moved to DC, is how much the government still has to deal with paper. This is a facility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where people were worried that the building might be structurally unsound from the weight of all that paper. Yeah. ",
    " Paper has some downsides. Here's a pop quiz: If your last name starts with H or higher, H or higher, would you raise your hand? Wow. I have some bad news: Your veteran records might have been destroyed in a fire in 1973. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Yeah. Paper processes are also slower and more prone to errors. If you're a veteran and you're applying for your health benefits using a paper form, you might have to wait months for that form to be processed. We replaced that with a web form, and now most veterans find out if they can get access to their health benefits in 10 minutes. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Here's another launch that I'm proud of. We worked with the Small Business Administration to move one of their systems from paper to digital. So this is a picture from before, and this is afterwards. Same cubicles, same people, just a better system for everyone. ",
    " At one point, we wanted to celebrate modernizing a different system, and so we went to a local grocery store and we said, \"Can you make a cake and decorate it with the form that we've digitized?\" And the grocery store got really weirded out by that request. They wanted a letter on official government letterhead. Well, we work for the government, so we wrote a letter that said, \"You can use this public-domain form on a cake for celebratory purposes.\" ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Which led to bad jokes about filling forms out in triplicake. Yes, dad jokes in government. ",
    " Now I've talked a lot about paper, but we also bring up computer systems that go down. We bring in modern technology practices, like user-centered design and the cloud, and we also help improve procurement. It turns out government buys software the same way that it buys chairs and brownies and tanks: from government regulations that are over 1,000 pages long. So yes, there's some stuff that's messed up in government right now. But if you think Silicon Valley is the savior in this story, ",
    " (Laughs) ",
    " you've got another thing coming. Some of the best and brightest minds in technology are working on meal-delivery start-ups and scooters and how to deliver weed to people better. Is that really the most important thing to work on right now? Silicon Valley likes to talk about making the world a better place. But you feel your impact in a much more visceral way in government. ",
    " This is somebody whose dad passed away. He hunted me down on Twitter to say that a system that we had improved worked well for him during a tough time. Those tough times are when government needs to work well and why we need innovation in government. ",
    " Now I have a confession to make. When I came to DC, I sometimes used words like bureaucrat. These days, I'm much more likely to use words like civil servant. Like Francine, who can make you cry. Or at least, she made me cry, because she's so inspiring. I am also deeply, fiercely proud of my colleagues. They will work through illogical situations and put in late nights to get to the right result. The government can't pay huge salary bonuses, so we ended up making our own awards. Our mascot is a crab named Molly. And so that award is actually a crab-shaped purse, screwed into sheet metal. ",
    " These days, I believe less in silver bullets that are going to fix everything. I believe more in the people who show up to help. If you're looking for something deeply meaningful \u2014 and full disclosure, sometimes incredibly frustrating \u2014 here's what you need to know. There is something difficult and messy and vital and magical happening when civil servants partner with technologists at the city and state and national level. You don't have to do it forever. But you can make a difference in public service right now. ",

    " Gripped with vengeful passion, The Queen of the Night  tears across the stage. She begins to sing her titular aria, one of the most famous sections  from Mozart\u2019s beloved opera, \"The Magic Flute.\" The orchestra fills the hall with music, but the queen\u2019s voice soars above  the instruments. Its melody rings out  across thousands of patrons, reaching seats 40 meters away\u2014 all without any assistance  from a microphone. How is it possible that this single voice can be heard so clearly, above the strains  of dozens of instruments? The answer lies in the physics  of the human voice, and the carefully honed technique  of an expert opera singer. ",
    " All the music in this opera house  originates from the vibrations created by instruments\u2014 whether it\u2019s the strings of a violin  or the vocal folds of a performer. These vibrations send waves into the air,  which our brains interpret as sound. The frequency of these vibrations\u2013\u2013 specifically, the number  of waves per second\u2013\u2013 is how our brains determine  the pitch of a single note. But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination  of multiple vibrations. Imagine a guitar string vibrating  at its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and this low pitch is what our ears  mostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration triggers  additional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental. These overtones break down  into specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials\u2014 and manipulating them  is how opera singers work their magic. ",
    " Every note has a set of frequencies  that comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates  at twice the frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times  the fundamental\u2019s frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments  produce harmonic series, but each instrument\u2019s shape and material changes the balance of its harmonics. For example, a flute emphasizes  the first few partials, but in a clarinet\u2019s lowest register, the odd-numbered partials  resonate most strongly. The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument its unique sonic signature. It also affects an instrument\u2019s ability  to stand out in a crowd, because our ears are more strongly  attuned to some frequencies than others. ",
    " This is the key to an opera singer\u2019s  power of projection. An operatic soprano\u2014 the highest of the four standard  voice parts\u2014 can produce notes  with fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500 vibrations  per second. Human ears are most sensitive  to frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000  vibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out  the partials in this range, she can target a sensory sweet spot  where she\u2019s most likely to be heard. Higher partials are also advantageous because there\u2019s less competition  from the orchestra, whose overtones are weaker  at those frequencies. The result of emphasizing  these partials is a distinctive ringing timbre  called a singer\u2019s squillo. ",
    " Opera singers work for decades  to create their squillo. They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension  in their vocal folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position  of their tongues and lips, they accentuate some overtones  while dampening others. Singers also increase their range  of partials with vibrato\u2014 a musical effect in which a note  slightly oscillates in pitch. This creates a fuller sound  that rings out over the instruments\u2019  comparatively narrow vibratos. ",
    " Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques  to boost their volume. Singers expand their lung capacity  and perfect their posture for consistent, controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect  sound waves towards the audience. ",
    " All singers take advantage  of these techniques, but different vocal signatures  demand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer needs  to build up stamina to power through the composer\u2019s  four-hour epics. While bel canto singers require  versatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias. Biology also sets some limits\u2014 not every technique is feasible  for every set of muscles, and voices change as singers age. ",
    " But whether in an opera hall  or a shower stall, these techniques can turn  un-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces. "

    " I was an eight-year-old kid in the mid-1990s. I grew up in southern Philippines. At that age, you're young enough to be oblivious about what society expects from each of us but old enough to be aware of what's going on around you. We lived in a one-bedroom house, all five of us. Our house was amongst clusters of houses made mostly of wood and corrugated metal sheets. These houses were built very close to each other along unpaved roads. There was little to no expectation of privacy. Whenever an argument broke out next door, you heard it all. Or, if there was a little ... something something going on \u2014 ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " you would probably hear that, too. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Like any other kid, I learned what a family looked like. It was a man, a woman, plus a child or children. ",
    " But I also learned it wasn't always that way. There were other combinations that worked just as well. There was this family of three who lived down the street. The lady of the house was called Lenie. Lenie had long black hair, often in a ponytail, and manicured nails. She always went out with a little makeup on and her signature red lipstick. Lenie's other half, I don't remember much about him except that he had a thing for white sleeveless shirts and gold chains around his neck. Their daughter was a couple years younger than me. Now, everybody in the village knew Lenie. She owned and ran what was the most popular beauty salon in our side of town. Every time their family would walk down the roads, they would always be greeted with smiles and occasionally stopped for a little chitchat. ",
    " Now, the interesting thing about Lenie is that she also happened to be a transgender woman. She exemplified one of the Philippines' long-standing stories about gender diversity. Lenie was proof that oftentimes we think of something as strange only because we're not familiar with it, or we haven't taken enough time to try and understand. ",
    " In most cultures around the world, gender is this man-woman dichotomy. It's this immovable, nonnegotiable, distinct classes of individuals. We assign characteristics and expectations the moment a person's biological sex is determined. But not all cultures are like that. Not all cultures are as rigid. Many cultures don't look at genitalia primarily as basis for gender construction, and some communities in North America, Africa, the Indian subcontinent and the Pacific Islands, including the Philippines, have a long history of cultural permissiveness and accommodation of gender variances. ",
    " As you may know, the people of the Philippines were under Spanish rule for over 300 years. That's from 1565 to 1898. This explains why everyday Filipino conversations are peppered with Spanish words and why so many of our last names, including mine, sound very Spanish. This also explains the firmly entrenched influence of Catholicism. But precolonial Philippine societies, they were mostly animists. They believed all things had a distinct spiritual essence: plants, animals, rocks, rivers, places. Power resided in the spirit. Whoever was able to harness that spiritual power was highly revered. ",
    " Now, scholars who have studied the Spanish colonial archives also tell us that these early societies were largely egalitarian. Men did not necessarily have an advantage over women. Wives were treated as companions, not slaves. And family contracts were not done without their presence and approval. In some ways, women had the upper hand. A woman could divorce her husband and own property under her own name, which she kept even after marriage. She had the prerogative to have a baby or not and then decide the baby's name. ",
    " But the real key to the power of the precolonial Filipino woman was in her role as \"babaylan,\" a collective term for shamans of various ethnic groups. They were the community healers, specialists in herbal and divine lore. They delivered babies and communicated with the spirit world. They performed exorcisms and occasionally, and in defense of their community, they kicked some ass. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " And while the babaylan was a female role, there were also, in fact, male practitioners in the spiritual realm. Reports from early Spanish chroniclers contain several references to male shamans who did not conform to normative Western masculine standards. They cross-dressed and appeared effeminate or sexually ambiguous. A Jesuit missionary named Francisco Alcina said that one man he believed to be a shaman was \"so effeminate that in every way he was more a woman than a man. All the things the women did he performed, such as weaving blankets, sewing clothes and making pots. He danced also like they did, never like a man, whose dance is different. In all, he appeared more a woman than a man.\" ",
    " Well, any other juicy details in the colonial archives? Thought you'd never ask. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " As you may have deduced by now, the manner in which these precolonial societies conducted themselves didn't go over so well. All the free-loving, gender-variant-permitting, gender equality wokeness clashed viciously with the European sensibilities at the time, so much so that the Spanish missionaries spent the next 300 years trying to enforce their two-sex, two-gender model. Many Spanish friars also thought that the cross-dressing babaylan were either celibates like themselves or had deficient or malformed genitals. But this was pure speculation. Documents compiled between 1679 and 1685, called \"The Bolinao Manuscript,\" mentions male shamans marrying women. The Boxer Codex, circa 1590, provide clues on the nature of the male babaylan sexuality. It says, \"Ordinarily they dress as women, act like prudes and are so effeminate that one who does know them would believe they are women. Almost all are impotent for the reproductive act, and thus they marry other males and sleep with them as man and wife and have carnal knowledge.\" Carnal knowledge, of course, meaning sex. ",
    " Now, there's an ongoing debate in contemporary society about what constitutes gender and how it should be defined. My country is no exception. Some countries like Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Nepal and Canada have begun introducing nonbinary options in their legal documents, such as their passports and their permanent resident cards. ",
    " In all these discussions about gender, I think it's important to keep in mind that the prevailing notions of man and woman as static genders anchored strictly on biological sex are social constructs. In my people's case, this social construct is an imposition. It was hammered into their heads over hundreds of years until they were convinced that their way of thinking was erroneous. But the good thing about social constructs is they can be reconstructed to fit a time and age. They can be reconstructed to respond to communities that are becoming more diverse. And they can be reconstructed for a world that's starting to realize we have so much to gain from learning and working through our differences. ",
    " When I think about this subject, I think about the Filipino people and an almost forgotten but important legacy of gender equality and inclusivity. I think about lovers who were some of the gentlest souls I had known but could not be fully open. I think about people who have made an impact in my life, who showed me that integrity, kindness and strength of character are far better measures of judgment, far better than things that are beyond a person's control such as their skin color, their age or their gender. ",
    " As I stand here today, on the shoulders of people like Lenie, I feel incredibly grateful for all who have come before me, the ones courageous enough to put themselves out there, who lived a life that was theirs and in the process, made it a little easier for us to live our lives now. Because being yourself is revolutionary. And to anyone reeling from forces trying to knock you down and cram you into these neat little boxes people have decided for you: don't break. I see you. My ancestors see you. Their blood runs through me as they run through so many of us. You are valid, and you deserve rights and recognition just like everyone else. ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " I came back to my home of Rwanda two years after the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. The country was devastated. The children I was caring for in the hospitals were dying from treatable conditions, because we didn't have equipment or medicine to save them. I was tempted to pack my bag and run away. But I debated with myself. And because I'm really dedicated to social justice and equity, and there were only five pediatricians in total for millions of children in Rwanda, I decided to stay. ",
    " But among the people who have motivated my decision to stay, there were some fantastic women of Rwanda, some women who had faced the genocide and survived it. They had to overcome unbelievable pain and suffering. Some of them were raising children conceived through rape. Others were dying slowly with HIV and forgave the perpetrators, who voluntarily infected them using HIV and rape as a weapon. So, they inspired me. If they can do that, I can stay and try to do my best. ",
    " Those ladies were really activists of peace and reconciliation. They show us a way to rebuild a country for our children and grandchildren to have, one day, a place they can call home, with pride. ",
    " And you can ask yourself where this shift of mindset has brought our country. Today in Rwanda, we have the highest percentage of women in parliament. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Wait till I tell you the percentage \u2014 sixty-one percent. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Today, we have the best campaign for the vaccination of children with, among our success, 93 percent of our girls vaccinated against HPV \u2014 ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " to protect them against cervical cancer. In this country, it's 54. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " We have reduced child mortality by 75 percent, maternal mortality by 80 percent. In early 2000s, there were nine women who were dying every day around delivery and pregnancy. Today, it's around two. It's an unfinished agenda. We still have a long way to go. Two is still too much. ",
    " But, do I believe that those results are because we had a big number of women in power positions? I do. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " There is \u2014 yes \u2014 ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " there is a study in the developing world that shows that if you improve the status of women, you improve the status of the community where they live. Up to 47 percent of decrease in child mortality. And even in this country where we are now, it's true. There is a study by a lady called Patricia Homan, who projected that if women and men were at parity in state legislatures, there would be a drop of 14.5 percent in child mortality \u2014 in America! ",
    " So we know that women, when they use their skills in leadership positions, they enhance the entire population they are in charge of. And imagine what would happen if women were at parity with men all over the world. What a huge benefit we could expect. Hmm? Oh, yeah. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Because in general, we have a different style of leadership: more inclusive, more empathetic, more caring for little children. And this makes the difference. ",
    " Unfortunately, this ideal doesn't exist in the world, and the difference between men and women in leadership positions is too big. Gender inequity is the norm in the majority of professions, even in global health. ",
    " I have learned that if we focus on women's education, we improve their life positively as well as the well-being of their community. This is why now I dedicate my life to education. And this is totally aligned with my sense of equity and my pursuit of social justice, because if you want to increase access to health services, you need first to increase access to health education. ",
    " So with friends and partners, we are building a beautiful university in the rural north of Rwanda. We educate our students to provide quality, equitable, holistic care to everyone, leaving no one out, focusing on the vulnerable, especially women and children, who are historically the last to be served. We transform them into leaders and give them managerial skills and advocacy skills for them to be smooth changemakers in the society where they will be, so that they can build health systems that allow them to care about the vulnerable where they are. ",
    " And it's really transformative. Because currently, medical education, for example, is given in institutions based in cities, focused on quality health services and skills, clinical skills, to be given in institutions. We also focus on quality clinical skills but with biosocial approach to the condition of patient, for care to be given in communities where the people live, with hospitalization only when necessary. And also, after four to seven years of clinical education in cities, young graduates don't want to go back to rural area. So this is why we have built the University of Global Health Equity, an initiative of Partners in Health, called UGHE, in the rural north of Rwanda. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Our students are meant to go and change the world. They will come from all over \u2014 it's a global university \u2014 and will get the medical education for free at one condition: they have to serve the vulnerable across the world during six to nine years. They will keep the salary for themselves and their families but turn the education we give in quality clinical services, especially for the vulnerable. And doing so, they sign an agreement at the start that they will do that, a binding agreement. We don't want money. We have to go and mobilize the money. But they will turn this in quality service delivery for all. ",
    " For this, of course, we need a strong gender equity agenda. And in all our classes, master's course, minimum of 50 percent of women. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " And I'm proud to say that for the medical school that started five months ago, we have enrolled 70 percent girls. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " This is a statement against the current inequity for women to access medical education in our continent. ",
    " I believe in women's education. This is why I applaud African ladies who go all over the world to increase their education, their skills and their knowledge. But I hope they will bring that back to Africa to build the continent and make the continent a strong continent, because I'm sure a stronger Africa will make the world stronger. ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Twenty-three years ago, I went back to Rwanda, to a broken Rwanda, that now is still a poor country but shining with a bright future. And I am full of joy to have come back, even if some days were very difficult, and even if some days I was depressed, because I didn't find a solution and people were dying, or things were not moving enough. But I'm so proud to have contributed to improve my community. And this makes me full of joy. ",
    " So, African women from the diaspora, if you hear me, never forget your homeland. And when you are ready, come back home. I did so. It has fulfilled my life. So, come back home. ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " At roughly 4pm on July 20, 1969, mankind was just minutes away  from landing on the surface of the moon. But before the astronauts  began their final descent, an emergency alarm lit up. Something was overloading  the computer, and threatened to abort the landing. ",
    " Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton  held her breath. She'd led the team developing  the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission  had no room for error. But the nature  of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software  was working exactly as planned. ",
    " Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana,  Hamilton had always been inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics and philosophy, before taking a research position at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she encountered her first computer while developing software to support research  into the new field of chaos theory. ",
    " Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software  for America\u2019s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft. But when she heard  that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help  sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team. ",
    " NASA looked to Draper and his group  of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact  digital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible  for guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers  filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate  without any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space. ",
    " Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware  and one for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built  the on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term \u201csoftware engineering,\" was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line,  so every program had to be perfect. Margaret\u2019s software needed to quickly detect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time. ",
    " But this kind of adaptable program  was difficult to build, since early software could only process  jobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program  to be \u201casynchronous,\u201d meaning the software's more important jobs would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task  a unique priority to ensure that each job  occurred in the correct order and at the right time\u2014 regardless of any surprises. ",
    " After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software  could help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt  astronaut\u2019s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies. The astronaut could then communicate with Mission Control to determine the best path forward. This marked the first time flight software communicated directly\u2014 and asynchronously\u2014  with a pilot. ",
    " It was these fail safes that triggered  the alarms just before the lunar landing. Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake\u2014 he\u2019d inadvertently flipped  the rendezvous radar switch. This radar would be essential  on their journey home, but here it was using up  vital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer was well equipped to manage this. During the overload,  the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs  to be processed\u2014 including the programs  necessary for landing. The Priority Displays  gave the astronauts a choice\u2014 to land or not to land. With minutes to spare,  Mission Control gave the order. ",
    " The Apollo 11 landing was about  the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together as an integrated system of systems. Hamilton\u2019s contributions were essential to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy\u2019s  goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work  went far beyond Apollo 11\u2014 no bugs were ever found in the in-flight software for any crewed Apollo missions. ",
    " After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses  its unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs  for systems and software. In 2003, NASA honored her achievements  with the largest financial award they\u2019d ever given to an individual.

    " I'm going to start by saying something you think you know to be true. Your brain creates all facets of your mind. So then why do we treat mental and physical illnesses so differently, if we think we know that the mind comes from the brain? As a neuroscientist, I'm often told that I'm not allowed to study how internal states like anxiety or craving or loneliness are represented by the brain, and so I decided to set out and do exactly that. ",
    " My research program is designed to understand the mind by investigating brain circuits. Specifically, how does our brain give rise to emotion. It's really hard to study feelings and emotions, because you can't measure them. Behavior is still the best and only window into the emotional experience of another. For both animals and people, yes, self-report is a behavioral output. ",
    " Motivated behaviors fall into two general classes: seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. The ability to approach things that are good for you and avoid things that are bad for you is fundamental to survival. And in our modern-day society, trouble telling the difference can be labeled as a mental illness. ",
    " If I was having car trouble, and I took my car to the mechanic, the first thing they do is look under the hood. But with mental health research, you can't just pop open the hood with the press of a button. So this is why we do experiments on animals. Specifically, in my lab, mice. To understand the brain, well, we need to study brains. And for the first time, we actually can. We can pop open the hood. We can look inside and do an experiment and see what comes out. ",
    " Technology has opened new windows into the black box that is our minds. The development of optogenetic tools has allowed us unprecedented control over specific neurons in the brain and how they talk to each other by firing electrical signals. We can genetically engineer neurons to be light sensitive and then use light to control how neurons fire. This can change an animal's behavior, giving us insight into what that neural circuit can do. Want to know how scientists figure this out? ",
    " Scientists developed optogenetic tools by borrowing knowledge from other basic science fields. Algae are single-celled organisms that have evolved to swim towards light. And when blue light shines onto the eyespot of an algae cell, a channel opens, sending an electrical signal that makes little flagella flap and propels the algae towards sunlight. If we clone this light-sensitive part of the algae and then add it to neurons through genetic modification, we can make neurons light-sensitive, too. Except, with neurons, when we shine light down an optical fiber deep into the brain, we change how they send electrical signals to other neurons in the brain and thus change the animal's behavior. ",
    " With the help of my colleagues, I pioneered the use of optogenetic tools to selectively target neurons that are living in point A, sending messages down wires aimed at point B, leaving neighboring neurons going other places unaffected. This approach allowed us to test the function of each wire within the tangled mess that is our brain. ",
    " A brain region called the amygdala has long been thought to be important for emotion, and my laboratory discovered that the amygdala resembles a fork in the road where activating one path can drive positive emotion and approach, and activating another path can drive negative emotion and avoidance. ",
    " I'm going to show you a couple of examples \u2014 a taste of raw data \u2014 of how we can use optogenetics to target specific neurons in the brain and get very specific changes in behavior. Anxiety patients have abnormal communication between two parts of the amygdala, but in people, it's hard to know if this abnormality is cause or effect of the disease. We can use optogenetics to target the same pathway in a mouse, and see what happens. ",
    " So this is the elevated plus maze. It's a widely used anxiety test that measures the amount of time that the mouse spends in the safety of the closed arms relative to exploring the open arms. Mice have evolved to prefer enclosed spaces, like the safety of their burrows, but to find food, water, mates, they need to go out into the open where they're more vulnerable to predatory threats. So I'm sitting in the background here, and I'm about to flip the switch. And now, when I flip the switch and turn the light on, you can see the mouse begins to explore the open arms of the maze more. And in contrast to drug treatments for anxiety, there's no sedation, no locomotor impairment, just coordinated, natural-looking exploration. So not only is the effect almost immediate, but there are no detectable side effects. ",
    " Now, when I flip the switch off, you can see that the mouse goes back to its normal brain function and back to its corner. When I was in the lab and I was taking these data, I was all by myself, and I was so excited. I was so excited, I did one of these quiet screams. ",
    " (Silently) Aah! ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " Why was I so excited? I mean, yeah, theoretically, I knew that the brain controlled the mind, but to flip the switch with my hand and see the mouse change its behavioral state so rapidly and so reversibly, it was really the first time that I truly believed it. ",
    " Since that first breakthrough, there have been a number of other discoveries. Finding specific neural circuits that can elicit dramatic changes in animal behavior. ",
    " Here's another example: compulsive overeating. We can eat for two reasons. Seeking pleasure, like tasty food, or avoiding pain, like being hungry. How can we find a treatment for compulsive overeating without messing up the hunger-driven feeding that we need to survive? The first step is to understand how the brain gives rise to feeding behavior. This fully-fed mouse is just exploring a space completely devoid of any food. Here we're using optogenetics to target neurons living in the hypothalamus, sending messages down wires aimed at the midbrain. When I turn the light on, right here, you can see that the mouse immediately begins licking the floor. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " This seemingly frenzied behavior is about to escalate into something I find really incredible. It's kind of trippy, actually. Ready? It's right here. See, he picks up his hands as if he is eating a piece of food, but there's nothing there, he's not holding anything. So this circuit is sufficient to drive feeding behavior in the absence of hunger, even in the absence of food. I can't know for sure how this mouse is feeling, but I speculate these neurons drive craving based on the behaviors we elicit when we target this pathway. Turn the light back off \u2014 animal's back to normal. When we silence this pathway, we can suppress and reduce compulsive overeating without altering hunger-driven feeding. ",
    " What did you take away from these two videos that I just showed you? That making a very specific change to neural circuits in the brain can have specific changes to behavior. That every conscious experience that we have is governed by cells in our brain. ",
    " I am the daughter of a physicist and a biologist, who literally met on the boat coming to America in pursuit of an education. So naturally, since there was \"no pressure\" to be a scientist ... ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " as a college student, I had to decide whether I wanted to focus on psychology, the study of the mind, or neuroscience, the study of the brain. And I chose neuroscience, because I wanted to understand how the mind is born out of biological tissue. But really, I've come full circle to do both. And now my research program bridges the gap between the mind and the brain. ",
    " Research from my laboratory suggests that we can begin to tie specific neural circuits to emotional states. And we have found a number of circuits that control anxiety-related behavior, compulsive overeating, social interaction, avoidance and many other types of motivated behaviors that may reflect internal emotional states. ",
    " We used to think of functions of the mind as being defined by brain regions. But my work shows that within a given brain region, there are many different neurons doing different things. And these functions are partly defined by the paths they take. ",
    " Here's a metaphor to help illustrate how these discoveries change the way that we think about the brain. Let's say that the brain is analogous to the world and that neurons are analogous to people. And we want to understand how information is transmitted across the planet. Sure, it's useful to know where a given person is located when recording what they're saying. But I would argue that it's equally important to know who this person is talking to, who is listening and how the people listening respond to the information that they receive. ",
    " The current state of mental health treatment is essentially a strategy of trial and error. And it is not working. The development of new drug therapies for mental health disorders has hit a brick wall, with scarcely any real progress since the 1950s. So what does the future hold? ",
    " In the near future, I expect to see a mental health treatment revolution, where we focus on specific neural circuits in the brain. Diagnoses will be made based on both behavioral symptoms and measurable brain activity. Further in the future, by combining our ability to make acute changes to the brain and get acute changes to behavior with our knowledge of synaptic plasticity to make more permanent changes, we could push the brain into a state of fixing itself by reprogramming neural circuits. Exposure therapy at the circuit level. ",
    " Once we switch the brain into a state of self-healing, this could potentially have long-lasting effects with no side effects. I can envision a future where neural circuit reprogramming represents a potential cure, not just a treatment. ",
    " OK, but what about right now? If from this very moment forward, each and every one of you left this talk and truly believed that the mind comes entirely from cells in your brain, then we could immediately get rid of negative perceptions and stigmas that prevent so many people from getting the mental health support that they need. ",
    " Mental health professionals, we're always thinking about what's the next new treatment. But before we can apply new treatments, we need people to feel comfortable seeking them. Imagine how dramatically we could reduce the rates of suicides and school shootings if everyone who needed mental health support actually got it. When we truly understand exactly how the mind comes from the brain, we will improve the lives of everyone who will have a mental illness in their lifetime \u2014 half the population \u2014 as well as everyone else with whom they share the world. ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " Six months ago, I watched with bated breath as NASA's InSight lander descended towards the surface of Mars. Two hundred meters, 80 meters, 60, 40, 20, 17 meters. Receiving confirmation of successful touchdown was one of the most ecstatic moments of my life. And hearing that news was possible because of two small cube sets that went along to Mars with InSight. Those two cube sets essentially livestreamed InSight's telemetry back to Earth, so that we could watch in near-real time as that InSight lander went screaming towards the surface of the red planet, hitting the atmosphere of Mars at a top speed of about 12,000 miles per hour. Now, that event was livestreamed to us from over 90 million miles away. It was livestreamed from Mars. ",
    " Meanwhile, the two Voyager spacecraft \u2014 now, these are these two almost unbelievably intrepid explorers. They were launched the same year that all of us here were being introduced to Han Solo for the first time. And they are still sending back data from interstellar space over 40 years later. ",
    " We are sending more spacecraft further into deep space than ever before. But every one of those spacecraft out there depends on its navigation being performed right here at Earth to tell it where it is and, far more importantly, where it is going. And we have to do that navigation here on Earth for one simple reason: spacecraft are really bad at telling the time. But if we can change that, we can revolutionize the way we explore deep space. ",
    " Now, I am a deep space navigator, and I know you're probably thinking, \"What is that job?\" Well, it is an extremely unique and also very fun job. I steer spacecraft, from the moment they separate from their launch vehicle to when they reach their destination in space. And these destinations \u2014 say Mars for example, or Jupiter \u2014 they are really far away. To put my job in context for you: it's like me standing here in Los Angeles and shooting an arrow, and with that arrow, I hit a target that's the size of a quarter, and that target the size of a quarter is sitting in Times Square, New York. ",
    " Now, I have the opportunity to adjust the course of my spacecraft a few times along that trajectory, but in order to do that, I need to know where it is. And tracking a spacecraft as it travels through deep space is fundamentally a problem of measuring time. You see, I can't just pull out my ruler and measure how far away my spacecraft is. But I can measure how long it takes a signal to get there and back again. And the concept is exactly the same as an echo. If I stand in front of a mountain and I shout, the longer it takes for me to hear my echo back at me, the further away that mountain is. So we measure that signal time very, very accurately, because getting it wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second might mean the difference between your spacecraft safely and gently landing on the surface of another planet or creating yet another crater on that surface. Just a tiny fraction of a second, and it can be the difference between a mission's life or death. ",
    " So we measure that signal time very, very accurately here on Earth, down to better than one-billionth of a second. But it has to be measured here on Earth. There's this great imbalance of scale when it comes to deep space exploration. Historically, we have been able to send smallish things extremely far away, thanks to very large things here on our home planet. As an example, this is the size of a satellite dish that we use to talk to these spacecraft in deep space. And the atomic clocks that we use for navigation are also large. The clocks and all of their supporting hardware can be up to the size of a refrigerator. Now, if we even want to talk about sending that capability into deep space, that refrigerator needs to shrink down into something that can fit inside the produce drawer. ",
    " So why does this matter? Well, let's revisit one of our intrepid explorers, Voyager 1. Voyager 1 is just over 13 billion miles away right now. As you know, it took over 40 years to get there, and it takes a signal traveling at the speed of light over 40 hours to get there and back again. And here's the thing about these spacecraft: they move really fast. And Voyager 1 doesn't stop and wait for us to send directions from Earth. Voyager 1 keeps moving. In that 40 hours that we are waiting to hear that echo signal here on the Earth, Voyager 1 has moved on by about 1.5 million miles. It's 1.5 million miles further into largely uncharted territory. So it would be great if we could measure that signal time directly at the spacecraft. ",
    " But the miniaturization of atomic clock technology is ... well, it's difficult. Not only does the clock technology and all the supporting hardware need to shrink down, but you also need to make it work. Space is an exceptionally harsh environment, and if one piece breaks on this instrument, it's not like we can just send a technician out to replace the piece and continue on our way. The journeys that these spacecraft take can last months, years, even decades. And designing and building a precision instrument that can support that is as much an art as it is a science and an engineering. ",
    " But there is good news: we are making some amazing progress, and we're about to take our very first baby steps into a new age of atomic space clocks. Soon we will be launching an ion-based atomic clock that is space-suitable. And this clock has the potential to completely flip the way we navigate. This clock is so stable, it measures time so well, that if I put it right here and I turned it on, and I walked away, I would have to come back nine million years later for that clock's measurement to be off by one second. ",
    " So what can we do with a clock like this? Well, instead of doing all of the spacecraft navigation here on the Earth, what if we let the spacecraft navigate themselves? Onboard autonomous navigation, or a self-driving spacecraft, if you will, is one of the top technologies needed if we are going to survive in deep space. When we inevitably send humans to Mars or even further, we need to be navigating that ship in real time, not waiting for directions to come from Earth. And measuring that time wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second can mean the difference between a mission's life or death, which is bad enough for a robotic mission, but just think about the consequences if there was a human crew on board. ",
    " But let's assume that we can get our astronauts safely to the surface of their destination. Once they're there, I imagine they'd like a way to find their way around. Well, with this clock technology, we can now build GPS-like navigation systems at other planets and moons. Imagine having GPS on the Moon or Mars. Can you see an astronaut standing on the surface of Mars with Olympus Mons rising in the background, and she's looking down at her Google Maps Mars Edition to see where she is and to chart a course to get where she needs to go? ",
    " Allow me to dream for a moment, and let's talk about something far, far in the future, when we are sending humans to places much further away than Mars, places where waiting for a signal from the Earth in order to navigate is just not realistic. Imagine in this scenario that we can have a constellation, a network of communication satellites scattered throughout deep space broadcasting navigation signals, and any spacecraft picking up that signal can travel from destination to destination to destination with no direct tie to the Earth at all. ",
    " The ability to accurately measure time in deep space can forever change the way we navigate. But it also has the potential to give us some pretty cool science. You see, that same signal that we use for navigation tells us something about where it came from and the journey that it took as it traveled from antenna to antenna. And that journey, that gives us data, data to build better models, better models of planetary atmospheres throughout our solar system. We can detect subsurface oceans on far-off icy moons, maybe even detect tiny ripples in space due to relativistic gravity. ",
    " Onboard autonomous navigation means we can support more spacecraft, more sensors to explore the universe, and it also frees up navigators \u2014 people like me \u2014 to work on finding the answers to other questions. And we still have a lot of questions to answer. ",
    " We know such precious little about this universe around us. In recent years, we have discovered nearly 3,000 planetary systems outside of our own solar system, and those systems are home to almost 4,000 exoplanets. To put that number in context for you: when I was learning about planets for the first time as a child, there were nine, or eight if you didn't count Pluto. But now there are 4,000. It is estimated that dark matter makes up about 96 percent of our universe, and we don't even know what it is. All of the science returned from all of our deep space missions combined is just this single drop of knowledge in a vast ocean of questions. And if we want to learn more, to discover more, to understand more, then we need to explore more. ",
    " The ability to accurately keep time in deep space will revolutionize the way that we can explore this universe, and it might just be one of the keys to unlocking some of those secrets that she holds so dear. ",
    " Thank you. ",

    " I'm an artist and an engineer. And lately, I've been thinking a lot about how technology mediates the way we perceive reality. And it's being done in a superinvisible and nuanced way. Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality by masking itself as the actual experience of the world. As a result, we are becoming unconscious and unaware that it is happening at all. ",
    " Take the glasses I usually wear, for example. These have become part of the way I ordinarily experience my surroundings. I barely notice them, even though they are constantly framing reality for me. The technology I am talking about is designed to do the same thing: change what we see and think but go unnoticed. ",
    " Now, the only time I do notice my glasses is when something happens to draw my attention to it, like when it gets dirty or my prescription changes. So I asked myself, \"As an artist, what can I create to draw the same kind of attention to the ways digital media \u2014 like news organizations, social media platforms, advertising and search engines \u2014 are shaping our reality?\" So I created a series of perceptual machines to help us defamiliarize and question the ways we see the world. ",
    " For example, nowadays, many of us have this kind of allergic reaction to ideas that are different from ours. We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy. So I created a helmet that creates this artificial allergy to the color red. It simulates this hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger when you are wearing it. It has two modes: nocebo and placebo. In nocebo mode, it creates this sensorial experience of hyperallergy. Whenever I see red, the red expands. It's similar to social media's amplification effect, like when you look at something that bothers you, you tend to stick with like-minded people and exchange messages and memes, and you become even more angry. Sometimes, a trivial discussion gets amplified and blown way out of proportion. Maybe that's even why we are living in the politics of anger. In placebo mode, it's an artificial cure for this allergy. Whenever you see red, the red shrinks. It's a palliative, like in digital media. When you encounter people with different opinions, we will unfollow them, remove them completely out of our feeds. It cures this allergy by avoiding it. But this way of intentionally ignoring opposing ideas makes human community hyperfragmented and separated. ",
    " The device inside the helmet reshapes reality and projects into our eyes through a set of lenses to create an augmented reality. I picked the color red, because it's intense and emotional, it has high visibility and it's political. So what if we take a look at the last American presidential election map through the helmet? ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " You can see that it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican, because the mediation alters our perceptions. The allergy exists on both sides. ",
    " In digital media, what we see every day is often mediated, but it's also very nuanced. If we are not aware of this, we will keep being vulnerable to many kinds of mental allergies. ",
    " Our perception is not only part of our identities, but in digital media, it's also a part of the value chain. Our visual field is packed with so much information that our perception has become a commodity with real estate value. Designs are used to exploit our unconscious biases, algorithms favor content that reaffirms our opinions, so that every little corner of our field of view is being colonized to sell ads. Like, when this little red dot comes out in your notifications, it grows and expands, and to your mind, it's huge. ",
    " So I started to think of ways to put a little dirt, or change the lenses of my glasses, and came up with another project. Now, keep in mind this is conceptual. It's not a real product. It's a web browser plug-in that could help us to notice the things that we would usually ignore. Like the helmet, the plug-in reshapes reality, but this time, directly into the digital media itself. It shouts out the hidden filtered voices. What you should be noticing now will be bigger and vibrant, like here, this story about gender bias emerging from the sea of cats. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " The plug-in could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm. Like, here in this comment section, there are lots of people shouting about the same opinions. The plug-in makes their comments super small. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " So now the amount of pixel presence they have on the screen is proportional to the actual value they are contributing to the conversation. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " The plug-in also shows the real estate value of our visual field and how much of our perception is being commoditized. Different from ad blockers, for every ad you see on the web page, it shows the amount of money you should be earning. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " We are living in a battlefield between reality and commercial distributed reality, so the next version of the plug-in could strike away that commercial reality and show you things as they really are. ",
    " (Laughter) ",
    " (Applause) ",
    " Well, you can imagine how many directions this could really go. Believe me, I know the risks are high if this were to become a real product. And I created this with good intentions to train our perception and eliminate biases. But the same approach could be used with bad intentions, like forcing citizens to install a plug-in like that to control the public narrative. It's challenging to make it fair and personal without it just becoming another layer of mediation. ",
    " So what does all this mean for us? Even though technology is creating this isolation, we could use it to make the world connected again by breaking the existing model and going beyond it. By exploring how we interface with these technologies, we could step out of our habitual, almost machine-like behavior and finally find common ground between each other. ",
    " Technology is never neutral. It provides a context and frames reality. It's part of the problem and part of the solution. We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception and consequently, choose how we see each other. ",
    " Thank you. ",
